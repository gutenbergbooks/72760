<span class="fs80">THE CALL OF DUTY OVERSEAS</span></h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> task of the American Navy in the great
conflict was performed exceedingly well, but
so very quietly that even now the merits of the
achievement are realized only by those who knew
how near the German submarine campaign came
to winning the war. There was no blacker period
than the spring of 1917 when the losses of Allied
merchant shipping were mounting toward a million
tons a month, and the Admiralty was well aware
that England stood face to face with starvation
and defeat unless this piracy could soon be checked.
It was when Admiral Sims cabled to his own Government,
from London, “Briefly stated, I consider
that at the present moment we are losing the
war”; when Admiral Jellicoe privately admitted,
“It is impossible for us to go on if losses like this
continue”; and when Lord Balfour could see no
escape from the same tragic conclusion.</p>

<p>The facts were purposely concealed from the
people of both countries, and even after the declaration
of war the attitude of the American mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
was all too leisurely, while the British grimly hung
on and tightened their belts with the tenacity of
the breed. The battleship squadrons of the Grand
Fleet still dominated the surface of the Seven Seas,
but they were helpless to aid in this vital problem.
It was perceived that the chief hope of salvation
was in massing destroyers to protect the converging
trade routes of the Irish Sea and the English Channel
and thereby increasing the supply of food and
material. For this service the British Navy was
able to spare a flotilla of less than a score of these
craft, a patrol force obviously inadequate. These
were the reasons why the fleet of thirty-five fast
and powerful American destroyers was sent across
the Atlantic, and why Queenstown was chosen as
the strategic base port.</p>

<p>As soon as the troop-ships began to move overseas,
these destroyers were able to extend their operations
and to help guard and escort the convoys
through the Bay of Biscay to the coast of France.
Meanwhile another urgent situation had developed
and an appeal no less insistent had been conveyed
to Washington. The navy of France was mostly in
the Mediterranean where it properly belonged, and
the small patrol force off the stormy shores of
Brittany was racked, weary, almost discouraged.
Thousands of French sailors had been sent from
the ships and bases to fight in the trenches. The
little torpedo boats and trawlers were unable to
cope with the U-boats which ran amuck among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
precious coastwise convoys or intercepted the ships
that were homeward bound from distant voyages.</p>

<p>France was magnificent, but her maritime
strength in the Atlantic was almost spent. To safeguard
the approaches to her ports in which American
regiments and divisions were to be landed,
hundreds of thousands of men, with their mountains
of supplies, was more than she could attempt.
Help was needed and the American Navy was eager
to respond, but no more destroyers were available.
It was necessary to retain a certain number of
them in home waters as units of the fighting fleet
of big ships which was held in readiness for whatever
emergency the war might suddenly unfold. To
France, therefore, the Navy was compelled to send
whatever it could lay hands on at short notice, planning
to reinforce this vanguard with destroyers as
fast as they could be launched and commissioned.</p>

<p>In these circumstances the only ships which
could be hastily fitted out and sent across were the
larger yachts, about twenty in number, whose
owners had enrolled and offered them for service
when the war clouds were gathering. It had been
expected that these pleasure craft, with their volunteer
officers and crews, would be used only in
the coastal patrol areas and not for duty in the
war zone, and in the naval organization they were
defined as belonging to “Class IV,” which had a
limited field of operation. This was no obstacle, it is
needless to say, for when the greater opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
offered, the amateur bluejackets who manned these
yachts were eager to shift into “Class II,” or combatant
ships, and to sign on for the adventure in
the war zone.</p>

<p>The story of one of these yachts which bravely
endured almost two years of battering service in
foreign waters is more than a record of a single ship,
for it will convey, I hope, something of the spirit
and the experiences which they all shared together
and which the Navy at large regards with pride as
worthy of its traditions. These ships were flung into
work for which they were presumably unfitted, into
a kind of warfare which was wholly novel, and they
sailed with crews who were mostly greenhorns, but
they passed the test with flying colors and their admiral
who commanded the American Naval Forces
in France took pleasure in writing, not long ago:</p>

<p>I am glad that you are to write the war story of the
<em>Corsair</em> because the story of the yachts that came to
France in 1917 is well worthy of record. These vessels,
designed for pleasure and manned, in large part, by
officers and men of little naval training, but of unconquerable
spirit, were by peculiar circumstances given
an important rôle in the war.</p>

<p>Because of the lack of destroyers, the yachts contributed
a large share of the American naval effort on
the French coast during the summer and fall of 1917—trying
months of the submarines’ greatest activity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>Their work then and subsequently, whether on troop
and store-ship escort in the Bay of Biscay, convoy escort
through the difficult coastal channels of France,
or on the Gironde convoys, was frequently hazardous
and was always well done.</p>

<p>Such was the “Suicide Fleet” as it was dubbed by
certain pessimists who were later compelled to eat
their words. Of these yachts one of the largest and
fastest was the <em>Corsair</em>, owned by J. Pierpont
Morgan, and the second of her name to fly the pennant
of the American Navy in war-time. The first
<em>Corsair</em> was renamed the <em>Gloucester</em> and won a
well-deserved renown at Santiago in 1898, under
Lieutenant Commander Richard Wainwright, who
engaged two Spanish destroyers, driving one ashore
and sinking the other in the most brilliant single
exploit of that battle. In size and armament either
destroyer was more than a match for the converted
yacht, called a gunboat by courtesy, whose main
battery consisted of four six-pounders. This was
the kind of blue-water warfare which American
sailors would have vastly preferred in 1917, ship
to ship, between honorable foemen, as navies had
fought in days gone by.</p>

<p>The contrast between the naval careers of these
two <em>Corsairs</em> is wide and significant. The older ship
had known what to expect, a certain chivalry of
the sea which had never been obscured, even when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
men slew each other with cutlass and boarding-pike
upon reddened decks. It was exemplified in the conduct
of the Spanish Admiral Cervera, and reflected
in the behavior of Captain “Jack” Phillip of the
<em>Texas</em> when he shouted to his bluejackets in the
moment of victory, “Don’t cheer, boys. The poor
devils are dying.”</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> of twenty years later was to sail
against an enemy who skulked beneath the sea with
malice toward all and mercy toward none, who
counted women and children as fair prey in war,
and whose trail was marked by the agonies of unarmed
and helpless castaways adrift in open boats.</p>

<p>This <em>Corsair</em> was no fragile, fair-weather yacht
whose cruises had been confined to sheltered reaches,
but a powerful ship familiar with the Atlantic in all
seasons. She was no longer young, as vessels go,
with eighteen years of service to her credit, but
the Lloyd’s surveyor rated her as staunch and
sound in every respect. As a yacht the <em>Corsair</em> had
made six voyages to Europe, while owned by the
late J. Pierpont Morgan, and her shapely lines were
known to mariners from the Channel ports to the
Mediterranean and the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>A faithful ship which has long withstood the
ordeals of the sea becomes something more than a
mere fabric of steel and wood. She seems almost
sentient, like a living thing to those who have
shared her fortunes, and therein is the immemorial
romance which the sea peculiarly vouchsafes. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
obvious to sailor-men that these many years of fidelity,
in winter gales and summer breezes, should have
endeared the <em>Corsair</em> to her owners, father and son.</p>

<p>Designed by J. Beavor Webb, the yacht was
built for offshore work, although not with the
expectation that she would be used as a “fourth-rate
gunboat” in the Bay of Biscay for a year and
a half on end. This was too much to ask of a vessel
so planned and arranged, but like the men of the
Navy she proved that she could do a little better
than her best. Her length was three hundred and
four feet, with a beam of thirty-three and a half
feet, a draft of seventeen feet, and a measurement
of sixteen hundred tons—noble dimensions for a
pleasure craft. The unusual speed of nineteen knots
was maintained, when necessary, in the war zone.
Her yachting complement comprised fifty-five officers
and men. With spacious decks and living quarters,
the <em>Corsair</em> was rather comfortable than ornate.</p>

<p>Captain William B. Porter had been in command
of her for sixteen years. He was a deep-water
sailor whose youth had known a merchant marine
now vanished, the stately sailing ships from ports
“down east” which lifted sky sail yards to the
breath of the Pacific trades or snugged down to
breast the tempests of Cape Horn. He knew shipwreck
and the peril and misery of an open boat
adrift in Far Eastern seas. He had gone into steam,
at first on the China coast, and later he became an
officer in the American Line. During the Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
War he served on the auxiliary cruiser <em>Yale</em> with the
naval rank of lieutenant (junior grade), and was
given command of the Spanish Steamer <em>Rita</em> which
was captured as a prize and used as a transport.</p>

<p>When the <em>Corsair</em> was taken over by the Navy,
it was ruled that all vessels of this class should
be commanded by an officer of the regular service.
Captain Porter was appointed executive officer of
the yacht, which position he held until promoted
to command during her second year of duty in foreign
waters.</p>

<p>In April and May of 1917 the <em>Corsair</em> was overhauled
and refitted as a fighting craft at the yard
of the W. &amp; A. Fletcher Company in Hoboken, the
firm which had built her. The Navy is severely
practical and beauty was sacrificed to utility. The
bowsprit, which had added the finishing touch to
the fine sheer of the deck, was ruthlessly removed.
Canvas-screened platforms, or crow’s-nests, disfigured
the two tall masts. The white-pine decks,
whose spotlessness had been the officers’ pride,
were bored for gun mountings. Teakwood panels
which had covered the steel plates of the bulwarks
were sent ashore for storage. Plate-glass windows
were boarded up and gleaming brass-work painted
to decrease visibility and save the trouble of polishing
it. The quarter-deck, no longer inviting
to leisure with its awnings, cushions, and wicker
chairs, was measured for the track and gear of the
ready depth bombs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>The hardest problem was to stow a hundred and
more men below. The large dining-room forward
was stripped of its fittings and filled with tiers of
bunks and a few hammocks. Down the middle ran
two long mess tables, bare and scrubbed. Forty-five
men were taken care of in this space, and although
they could not have whirled a cat around
by the tail, they were no more crowded than is
customary in the Navy. Twenty-four more were
berthed in the forecastle. By ripping out bulkheads,
room was made in the “glory hole” for some of the
petty officers. The old quarters of the yacht’s
officers were given over to the chief petty officers.
The bluejackets overflowed into the hold and slept
close to the ice machine, where they philosophically
reflected that they were sure to keep cool in
the event of a torpedo attack.</p>

<p>The owner’s cabins and the library aft were occupied
by the commissioned officers. Although the
rugs and panels and much of the furniture were
removed and the ship had a bare, business-like
aspect, the officers found a certain luxury in the
fact that there were bathrooms enough to go round.
They ate in the forward house on deck and the
library served as an office, with gun supports extending
from the wide divans to the deck above.
The rough-and-ready transformation must have
seemed almost brutal to those of the crew who, for
many years, had striven for perfection of detail in
maintaining the <em>Corsair</em> as a yacht. As a fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
ship the gleaming black of the hull and the mahogany
houses were covered with sombre gray paint.</p>

<p>A naval crew was put aboard as soon as the quarters
were ready. For the most part they were eager
and youthful volunteers who had chosen the Navy
because it seemed to promise speedier action than
the Army. They had lost no time in enlisting, many
of them preferring the humble station of a bluejacket
to the delay incident to studying for a commission
at Plattsburg. The lack of seafaring experience
was atoned for by unbounded zeal and enthusiasm.
Their sublime ignorance was unclouded by
doubts. They yearned to fight German submarines
and expected to find them.</p>

<p>It was a democracy of the forecastle in which
social distinctions were thrown overboard as so
much rubbish. The yachts recruited many of their
men from the universities, from offices in Wall
Street and Broadway, and as sweating “gobs”
with blistered palms they rubbed elbows or bunked
with youngsters of all sorts and were proud of it.
Princeton was strong aboard the <em>Corsair</em>, and more
than a dozen of her sons, as a stentorian glee club,
enlivened the Bay of Biscay with praise of Old
Nassau. The older officers of the regular service
disliked this new word “gob” as undignified and
untraditional, but the Reserve Force adopted it
with pride as the badge of their high-hearted
fraternity.</p>

<br>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was fortunate in the officers assigned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>for the hazardous employments of the war zone.
Lieutenant Commander Theodore A. Kittinger,
U.S.N., was in command of the yacht, having been
transferred from the destroyer <em>Cushing</em> which had
taken part in the long and arduous training that
had whetted the flotilla personnel to a fine edge.</p>

<p>The service record of Commander Kittinger helps
one to realize how varied is the experience and how
rigorous the training of a naval officer, even in time
of peace. Graduated from Annapolis in 1901, he
served first in the battleship <em>Alabama</em>, of the North
Atlantic Squadron, as junior watch and division
officer, on deck and in the engine-room. As an
ensign he was in the converted yacht <em>Vixen</em> in 1903
when she cruised in Caribbean waters and kept an
eye on the attempt of the former Kaiser to meddle
in the affairs of Venezuela. Then shifted to the
China station, the youthful officer was in the monitor
<em>Monadnock</em> and the cruiser <em>New Orleans</em> during
the anti-foreign riots and the Russo-Japanese War.</p>

<p>Sent home to join the armored cruiser <em>West
Virginia</em>, Lieutenant Kittinger was an assistant
engineer officer in 1906 and again made the long
voyage to the Far East and the Pacific. He became
gunnery officer of the same ship before the tour
of sea duty ended and he was appointed assistant
inspector of ordnance at the Naval Gun Factory,
Washington. In 1910-13 he was senior engineer
officer of the battleship <em>Minnesota</em>, visiting Europe
and then to Cuba and Vera Cruz. Again ashore,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
he was in charge of the smokeless powder works at
Indian Head and executive officer of the station of
the Naval Proving Ground, going from there to the
Fore River Shipyard as naval inspector of machinery.
Then came two years of sea service in a destroyer.</p>

<p>As executive officer of the <em>Corsair</em>, Lieutenant
Commander Porter was an uncommonly experienced
and capable seaman and navigator and, of
course, knew the ship from keel to truck and what
she could do in all weathers. Third on the list was
Lieutenant Robert E. Tod as navigating officer.
He was one of the foremost yachtsmen of the
United States, a commodore of the Atlantic Yacht
Club, and a licensed master mariner who had sailed
his own large vessels without the aid of a skipper.
The gunnery officer, Ensign A. K. Schanze, was a
graduate of the Naval Academy who welcomed the
opportunity to return to the Service. The chief
engineer of the <em>Corsair</em>, J. K. Hutchison, who had
been in her for several years, decided to stand by
the ship through thick and thin, as did his assistants,
A. V. Mason and W. F. Hawthorn. This was
true also of Lieutenant R. J. McGuire who had
been the first officer of the yacht and of Boatswain
R. Budani and a number of the enlisted force.</p>

<p>The day’s work of making the <em>Corsair</em> ready for
sea, the unaccustomed drudgery and the uncertainty
which filled the ship with rumors, are reflected
in the letters and diaries of the youthful
seamen whose motto was, “We don’t know where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
we’re going but we’re on our way.” One of them
wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>April 3rd. 1917.</em> The President of the United States
to-day declared this nation to be at war with Germany....
<em>4th.</em> Have determined that I had better join the
Army or Navy, as we are really at war. Most of my
friends are going to try to go to Plattsburg and get
commissions. I do not think I shall do this.... <em>6th.</em> A
lot of men are planning to go to the Mosquito Fleet
school at Newport. I can’t see it. Will go on a foreign-bound
ship or none. Have decided to learn radio and
join the Navy as an operator if I can learn it soon.</p>

<p><em>April 13th.</em> Still plugging at radio. I am getting a
little impatient. Think I shall enlist very soon....
<em>20th.</em> Almost ready to leave the office. Hate to go, but
war is war and it’s no fault of mine. Sorry there is war,
but there is only one thing to do—see it through....
<em>26th.</em> Finished all my work in the office and took away
my things. I wonder if I’ll ever get through the war
and come back to my old job.... <em>27th.</em> On this day
I made my final determination to enlist in the Navy.
Saw Lieutenant Tod and Captain Porter who recommended
me for the <em>Corsair</em>. Was enrolled in the Navy
and assigned to this ship, with orders to report at once.
My rank is seaman....</p>

<p><em>May 2nd.</em> First day of decent weather on this ship
and we worked like slaves. Coaling, cleaning decks,
and drill. The food so far is good. Home liberty for the
night.... <em>3rd.</em> Was elected to mess, with Jack Faison.
Worst job in the world. We washed hundreds of dishes,
knives, etc., but got the fo’castle clean for the first
time.... <em>4th.</em> Same kind of work, although we added
setting-up exercises and semaphore. We were signed
out of the Reserves (for coast patrol) into Class II,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
regular U.S.N. service call.... <em>5th.</em> Spent most of the
morning learning knots in ropes. Also had to clean
decks. Brought aboard the small arms. Stood watch
from noon to 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Chased away two suspicious looking
Wops. Six men are to be sent off the ship soon.
If I am elected there is going to be one awful kick.</p>

<p><em>May 8th.</em> This morning we had boat drill and I
stroked the cutter. Then the head gunner and I showed
the rest of the men how to take down, sight, and load
a Springfield rifle. After that we practiced signals and
had infantry drill with full equipment. The new boatswain
treats ’em rough and he bawled me out all day.
Rumors on this ship spread like wildfire. First we are
to be a flagship and then a dispatch boat and then to
patrol the English Channel until nobody knows anything.
There goes the boatswain’s whistle which means
turn to.</p>

<p><em>May 11th.</em> Spent the entire day at the Armory getting
clothes. The only decent thing about Navy red-tape
is the cheap price which we pay for stuff. We
stood in line just seven hours. The <em>Corsair</em> now looks
like a real battleship. The paint is all on, also the gun
mountings. We hear that the Kaiser has offered a big
reward to the U-boat captain who sinks this boat, because
it belongs to J. P. Morgan. Here’s hoping he is
disappointed! I learned a new way yesterday of making
a deck-mop out of canvas. It is very useful....
<em>14th.</em> We got our orders to-day and sail for the Navy
Yard to-morrow. The dope is that we leave for good on
Friday. We expect to be sent to the coast of Maine for
two weeks’ target practice, then to Newport where we
get definite sailing orders for some foreign service....
<em>15th.</em> Had a good trip from Fletchers’ to the Navy
Yard and then a terrible day. We had to coal ninety
tons of soft coal in buckets and shovels. The crew is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
dog-tired and I never saw such a dirty crowd. I pray
we may never have to live to-day again.</p>

<p>(Note. Inserted later. <em>This day was repeated in
France once a week. We soon got so used to it that it
became routine.</em>)</p>

<p><em>May 16th.</em> We had been asleep two hours when the
fire call was rung and all hands had to march double-quick
to the <em>Princess Irene</em>, a converted German liner.
It was a pretty bad fire and we were detailed to haul
hose for three hours. To-day was spent in washing the
ship and loading meat aboard. We are taking on provisions
for six months. The work here in the Navy Yard
is something fierce and I shall be glad to go to sea. I
bought shore liberty from another gob for two dollars
to go home and take a bath.</p>

<p><em>May 17th.</em> To-day a strict censorship was put on us.
All our mail is read by the executive officer before we
send it out. Also no news of any kind is handed to us.
We are not even allowed to tell our families when or
where we sail. All the dope is that we are going abroad
soon. I visited the <em>Noma</em> and the <em>Harvard</em> to-night, but
they can’t compare with the <em>Corsair</em>. We also looked
over some of the battleships and destroyers. Eleven of
them left for France to-day. We now get home leave
once a week. I washed some clothes to-day. They were
in awful shape. We loaded ten tons more of provisions.
Also got shot in the arm for typhoid and was vaccinated.
I am all in to-night.</p>

<p><em>May 18th.</em> To-day has been more like the real Navy.
I was on anchor watch from 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to 6 and again in
the morning. I went aboard a submarine to-night and
it was the most interesting craft I have ever seen, but
I would not care to ship in her. My arm is a lot better
to-night, but still sore. The food is not nearly as good
as it was, mostly because the cook is lazy, but I think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
the skipper has got his number.... <em>19th.</em> It looks very
much as if we would sail any day now. All stores,
ammunition, etc., are aboard and we are living a life
of comparative ease. Now they say we are going to
convoy the United States Commission to Russia. I
hope we do.... <em>21st.</em> Captain Kittinger told us this
morning to get all the warm clothes we could as we
are going to a cold climate. This sounds like Russia
or the North Sea. Everybody says for sure we are going
over soon, so I guess that must be right. I was recommended
by the chief boatswain for a coxswain’s job
and I hope I get the appointment. Dave Tibbott got
one, too. Pay-day to-day, but I did not get a cent, as
by some error of the Department my name was not on
the list. Am studying hard on the deck and boat book
and the seaman’s manual.</p>

<p><em>May 22nd.</em> Got offered a job as yeoman, but I don’t
want to be a pen-pusher if I can help it. Mr. Tod
advised me to take it and say nothing if the commander
makes a point of it.... <em>24th.</em> This has been
a trying day. In the first place a lot more men were
transferred off the boat and it makes us all nervous.
So far eight have got the gate. I painted the skylights
and covers all the afternoon. We are still at the Navy
Yard. Because of the <em>Mongolia</em> accident all our ammunition
was condemned, so we had to unload it. The
weight to carry was enough to pull all the rivets out
of your back-bone. I suppose it will be the same when
we load it again. We still don’t know for sure whether
we will be kept on the boat. Several more men expect
to get the hook.</p>

<br>

<p><em>May 26th.</em> I have the P.O. mess. Dirty job. Another
man got canned to-day. I do wish they would settle on
the crew. I understand now that the <em>Corsair</em> will sail
for Gravesend, England, on Thursday. Mr. McGuire
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>told me last night that he is afraid some more men will
have to be put off for lack of room. It certainly keeps
us feeling jumpy.... <em>29th.</em> Coaled ship all day. It was
a frightful job. It was shot onto the decks and we
shovelled it into the bunkers. We took on 350 tons and
the dirt and coal dust are unspeakable. To add to the
discomfort it rained all day. To-morrow is a national
holiday, but not for us.</p>

<p><em>May 30.</em> To-day we spent washing the ship. We
turned loose the hose for four hours and it looks better,
but is not clean by a long shot. I have caught a rotten
cold. To-day more of the crew got fired. Thirty-two
regulars from the <em>South Carolina</em> came aboard to fill up
the crew. We now have a full complement.... <em>31st.</em>
Still raining. I have never known such beastly weather.
We are still loading stores and I don’t understand
where all the stuff is put. We are carrying the fleet
paymaster and the fleet postmaster, so it looks as if
we would also be the fleet dispatch boat on the other
side. Heaven only knows when we will sail. We have
been expecting to go every night. Liberty is very
scarce these days.</p>

<p><em>June 1st.</em> Still more rain. I don’t expect a decent
day this summer. We are still loading, loading, loading.
Food, clothes, and ammunition. A hundred and fifty
pounds on my back is nothing any more. They first
announced that we were to have liberty to-morrow and
then cancelled it. Haven’t been mess cook or on
watch for five days. Hope my good luck continues.
The regulars are a good bunch, with few exceptions,
and I am surprised that most of them are so young.
They run from nineteen to twenty-two on an average,
barring the petty officers who are older.</p>

<p><em>June 4th.</em> We sail definitely to-morrow, nobody
knows where. In the afternoon I went to the Subtreasury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
with the paymaster to get money. We both
carried guns and brought back $10,000 in gold to the
ship. It was some load to carry.... <em>5th.</em> We shoved
off from the Navy Yard at 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and are now heading
north in Long Island Sound. No idea yet where
we are heading for. We cruised in the Sound all day
and anchored at Whitestone for the night. Got our
battle billet to-day. I am as follows:</p>

<p><em>Fire.</em> Extinguisher in crew quarters.</p>

<p><em>Boat.</em> Big motor sailer.</p>

<p><em>Gun.</em> Fire control aft.</p>

<p><em>Arm and away.</em> Fire control aft.</p>

<p>This is a joke on me. It was raining the other morning
and we were getting under way. Everybody was
dressed in dirty working whites. The bos’n yelled at
me, “Hey, get the messenger for’ard.” I immediately
rushed down to my locker, broke out a clean suit of
whites, and reported to the bridge for messenger watch.
I could hear the bos’n cursing all over the deck. The
mate finally spotted me and asked what I was doing
on the bridge. I told him the bos’n had put me on
messenger watch, and the mate said, “Messenger
watch! Hell! The messenger is a rope, you poor boob!”
It turned out that the “messenger” was a long line
which was stowed forward and he was wondering what
in Sam Hill had happened to me. The “messenger” is
used to hoist the motor sailer.</p>

<p><em>June 6th.</em> Spent the morning overside, scrubbing the
ship. At one o’clock we hove anchor and cruised down
to Staten Island. There are eleven warships here with
us.... <em>7th.</em> Coaled ship all day at the Navy Yard.
Filled the bunkers and then put thirty tons on deck
in bags. The ship was a holy mess. Before breakfast
we were over the side scrubbing.... <em>8th.</em> Spent most
of the day washing the whole ship. We left the Navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Yard and are tied to a dock at the foot of 80th Street
in the Hudson River. The <em>Seattle</em>, <em>Birmingham</em>, and
the <em>Aphrodite</em> are anchored near us. Got paid $13.00
to-day. So much money makes me dizzy.</p>

<p><em>June 11th.</em> I got what amounts to a promotion. I am
signal-man on the bridge. I handle all the signals,
flags, semaphore, blinker, and searchlights, excepting
radio. It lets me out of all the hard deck work. It will
take lots of practice to make good, but I am coming
along fairly well.... <em>12th.</em> Three large transports are
anchored off us, crowded with regular infantry. We
hear we are to convoy them across. We shall be starting
very soon. The dope is that we are to act as convoy
all summer.... <em>13th.</em> We are told that there will be
no liberty to-night, so that means business. I called
up father and he came to see me and said good-bye.
The day was spent in putting on the finishing touches
for sea. We think we are going over with about thirty
other ships. The <em>Seattle</em> is the flagship. There will be
cruisers, destroyers, our type of vessel, and the transports....</p>
</div>

<p>This young sailor and his comrades were about to
take part in one of the most memorable voyages
in American history. The crowded transports at
which they gazed bore Pershing’s first contingent,
the vanguard of an army two million strong. They
presaged the enormous flow of troops and material,
the bridge of ships which should finally shatter the
military power of Germany. There was nothing
outwardly dramatic in this sailing of this little fleet
of transports. It stole out in secret and no newspaper
hinted at its departure. The men in khaki<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
belonged to regular regiments whose names and
numbers meant nothing to the people of their country.
It was to be the destiny of most of these unknown
men to fall, dead or wounded, on the fields
of France, but the regiments came back, and then
the country knew them as they marched down
Fifth Avenue, wildly cheered and pelted with
flowers—the stern, bronzed ranks of the First
Division.</p>

<p>They filled the decks of this first convoy, companies
and battalions of the Sixteenth, the Eighteenth,
the Twenty-Sixth, and the Twenty-Eighth
infantry regiments which were to win glory at tremendous
cost in the victorious assaults at Toul, at
Cantigny, at Soissons, at Saint-Mihiel, and in the
desperate advances of the Meuse and the Argonne.</p>

<p>It was the Navy’s job to shepherd them across
the sea in safety. While the crew of the <em>Corsair</em> was
busied with rumor and conjecture, her official record
or confidential “War Diary” briefly noted the facts
in the case:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>April 28th.</em> <em>Corsair</em> taken over by the Government
at Fletchers’ Ship Yard, Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>

<p><em>April 28th to May 15th.</em> Fitting out for duty as scout
patrol, Third Naval District. During first week in
May information was received that ship would operate

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>The instructions for warding off submarine attack
have more than a passing interest. They signified
a new chapter in the work of the American
Navy, with no doctrine as precedent—the task of
transporting an army across three thousand miles
of ocean and protecting it against an enemy which
was supremely confident that its undersea warfare
could not be thwarted, which had boasted that it
could prevent the landing of an American army in
France. In a way, this was a momentous experiment.
How thoroughly and intelligently the Navy
had studied the problem may be discerned in these
extracts from its confidential orders to the <em>Corsair</em>
and the other ships of the escort:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Reports of enemy submarine activity indicate that
the area of greatest activity is east of Longitude
Twenty West, and within a circle radius five hundred
miles from Fayal, Azores. Submarines may be operating
on the Atlantic coast of the United States and
Canada. Every effort has been made to hold secret the
sailing of the convoy but it may be assumed that the
departure of convoy from the United States and the
hour of departure will be communicated to the enemy.
It is possible that particular effort will be made by the
enemy to accomplish the destruction of the convoy,
and no part of the water traversed may be assumed to
be free from submarines.</p>

<p>Ships will make every effort to maintain distance
accurately and will be careful not to drop astern, particularly
at night or in thick weather. Speed will be
assigned by signal. During daylight every effort will
be made to determine the revolutions necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
make the speed of the convoy in order that each ship
may maintain a more nearly constant speed during
the darkness.</p>

<p>Convoy will be manœuvred as necessary by the
Battle Signal Book. Ships will manœuvre independently
in accordance with the Rules of the Road in all
cases when necessary to avoid collision. When convoy
alters course each ship of the convoy will turn in the
wake of the next ahead except in zigzagging when all
turn together.</p>

<p>There will be two well-protected and arranged lookout
stations aloft; one on each side of the mast as high
as possible, capable of holding four lookouts each.
There will be four well-protected and arranged lookout
stations on each side of the ship, capable of holding
two lookouts each. During daylight there will be
an officer in each top, in addition to lookouts. At all
times there will be an officer in charge of lookouts on
deck who will make periodic inspections. The communication
system from lookout stations to bridge
will be tested frequently.</p>

<p>Lookouts will be carefully selected for their fitness
for lookout duty—keen eyesight, intelligence, and
freedom from seasickness are essential qualities. A
school for lookouts will be held daily. They will be
instructed to report everything they see. In so far as
practicable they will be furnished with binoculars and
each lookout will always use the same glass. Each
lookout will be assigned a definite sector and will be
required to maintain the closest possible watch within
that sector, no matter what may be happening in other
sectors.</p>

<p>Gun crews will be at all times in the immediate
vicinity of their guns. One man of each crew will be
at all times on watch. Daily pointing, loading, and fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
control drills will be held. When conditions permit
and upon orders from the Group Convoy Commander,
target practice will be held in accordance with the
General Signal Book.</p>

<p>No radio message will be sent except in great emergency
involving the safety of the ship. A continuous
radio watch will be maintained. If it becomes necessary
to communicate by radio, the cipher contained
in the operation order will be used.</p>

<p>All vessels will be darkened so that no ray of light
shall show outboard between sunset and sunrise.
A single gleam of light may cause the loss of the ship.
Sentries will make constant rounds to insure the strict
enforcement of this order throughout the ship. Navigational
lights will not be shown except when specifically
ordered by the convoy commander or when immediately
necessary to avoid collision and then only long
enough to meet the emergency. Range lights will not
be shown and all lights will be dimmed to two miles
visibility.</p>

<p>Smoke from the funnels must be reduced to a minimum
both by day and night. All vessels will keep fuel
so trimmed that maximum speed can be maintained
toward end of voyage. Neither the whistle or the siren
shall be used in submarine waters except in case of
emergency. Care will be exercised that the leads of the
siren and whistle cords are such that these cannot be
accidentally pulled or become jammed.</p>

<p>A station bill will be prepared showing the stations
at fire quarters and abandon ship. Daily drills at fire
stations and abandon ship will be held until all persons
on board become familiar with their duties.</p>

<p>Necessary instructions in regard to rendezvous and
courses will be found in the sealed instructions. These
will be opened only as directed on the outside of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
envelope. Before dark a rendezvous for 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the day
following will be signalled by the Escort Commander.</p>

<p>Nothing that floats will be thrown overboard. All
waste material that can be burned will be burned. Tin
cans must be well punctured before being thrown overboard.
Garbage that cannot be burned shall be accumulated
in suitable receptacles and thrown overboard
from all ships simultaneously one hour after sunset
each night.</p>

<p class="center no-indent"><em>Submarine Attack</em></p>

<p>The following is generally accepted:</p>

<p>Submarines on surface are visible on the horizon.
Submarine awash is visible about five miles. Submarine
submerged, periscope showing, is not visible more
than two miles unless periscope appears against skyline.
Porpoising of submarine as it comes to the surface
to obtain sight through periscope creates a distinct
wake which is more clearly visible than the wake
of periscope when submarine is steadied.</p>

<p>Under poor conditions of atmosphere and sea the
probability of detecting a submarine decreases. It
follows that constant vigilance alone will insure the
early detection of a submarine. The wake of a torpedo
is distinctive and can easily be picked up in smooth
water at a distance of two thousand yards. In rough
water it is difficult to observe the wake.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Daylight attack by surface craft (enemy raider),
will be handled by signal from the Convoy Commander.
Daylight attack by submarines shall be
handled as follows by each vessel:</p>

<p>(a) Open fire instantly on any submarine sighted.
Don’t delay the first shot even if it is apt to go wild,—it
will show the direction of the submarine and will
have a pronounced moral effect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p>(b) Continue to fire as rapidly as possible. Short
shots interfere with the ability of the submarine to
see and aim.</p>

<p>(c) If submarine appears less than six points on bow
and not more than 2000 yards away, head for submarine
at best speed.</p>

<p>(d) If submarine appears more than six points on
bow, abeam, or on the quarter, head directly away
from submarine at best speed.</p>

<p>(e) If torpedo wake only is seen, fire gun immediately
and indicate direction to other ships and manœuvre
to avoid torpedo as in case of submarine, i.e.—turning
towards torpedo if less than six points.</p>

<p>(f) Other ships of convoy turn from direction of
submarine and scatter at best speed, maintaining
keenest lookout for torpedo wake and for a possible
mate of the attacking submarine.</p>

<p>(g) Resume course when it is deemed that your
vessel is outside the danger zone of attacking submarine.</p>

<p><em>Night Attack:</em>—All vessels instantly change course
ninety degrees either to port or starboard. Course will
be resumed before any vessel has proceeded ten miles
after ninety degrees change. If any vessel is damaged
by torpedo, that vessel will act independently and all
other vessels of convoy escape at best speed. The damaged
vessel may send out radio distress signals provided
for merchant vessels.</p>

<p>Owing to the presence of escorting ships it is not
probable that submarines will be caught on the surface
and therefore will not attempt to use her guns. It is
very probable that the first indication of the presence
of a submarine will be the wake of her torpedo.</p>

<p>Mines, floating or submerged, may be encountered.
All floating objects, the character of which is uncertain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
must be carefully avoided. Floating mines have
recently been encountered under the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) Two mines connected by lines.</p>

<p>(b) Secured to bottom of dummy periscopes which
were mounted in a box or other object.</p>

<p>(c) In waterlogged boats, used as decoys.</p>

<p>(d) Attached to wreckage of various kinds.</p>

<p>If submarine is sighted or if gunfire from any ship
indicates attack, destroyers and fast yachts of escort
will head at best speed in direction of submarine, force
it to submerge, and attack as conditions permit. They
will rejoin convoy at earliest possible moment. If any
ship is damaged by torpedo, two destroyers will stand
by ship, those nearest of escort, affecting such rescue
as may be necessary and possible.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> <em>Corsair</em> stood out to sea with the transports
and the escort in the morning of June
14th after a thick fog had delayed the departure
for several hours. As finally selected, the ship’s
company consisted of 130 officers and enlisted
men. The shifting fortunes of war were to scatter
most of them to other ships and stations during
the long exile overseas, and when the battered
yacht came home, only Commander Porter and
Lieutenant McGuire and eighteen of the crew of
this first muster roll were left on board.</p>

<p>Changes were so frequent that from first to last
almost three hundred men served in the <em>Corsair</em>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The ship proved to be a training school for officers,
and made an exceptional record in that thirteen of
her enlisted force and one warrant officer won commissions
during the war, some taking the examinations
while on foreign service and others being sent
to Annapolis for the intensive course of three
months and receiving the rank of temporary ensigns
in the regular naval organization. On deck
and below, men were rated as petty officers as rapidly
as they displayed aptitude, and few of the crew
failed to advance themselves. The spirit of the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
was eager and ambitious from the start and drudgery
could not dull it.</p>

<p>As a proper man-of-war the <em>Corsair</em> lived a complex
and disciplined programme of duty through
the twenty-four hours of the day. When she steamed
past Sandy Hook, outward bound, the complement
included a chief boatswain’s mate, one boatswain’s
mate, six coxswains, seven gunner’s mates, four
quartermasters, nineteen seamen, nineteen ordinary
seamen, three electricians, four radio operators,
a carpenter’s mate, two ship-fitters, a boiler
maker, a blacksmith, a chief machinist’s mate, one
machinist’s mate, a chief water tender, two water
tenders, four oilers, twenty-one firemen and coal
passers, a chief yeoman, three yeomen, a hospital
apprentice, a bugler, a cabin steward, four ship’s
cooks, and eight mess attendants.</p>

day of June 14, 1917, was as follows:</p>

<p>Many of these patriotic pilgrims were about to
undertake their first voyage on blue water, nor
could they foresee how much piteous woe can be
caused by the uneasy motion of a ship. The <em>Corsair</em>
was a lively boat, as the saying is, for her hull was
not moulded like a fat-bellied merchantman, and
she lifted to the seas with the graceful stride of a
Yankee clipper. And so when the transports plodded
out into the wide, wet Atlantic, not a few of the
bold mariners of the <em>Corsair</em> devoutly wished they
had enlisted in the Army. They were not disgraced,
however, for many a hard-shell of the regular Navy
has confessed to the pangs of seasickness. The nervous
thoughts of submarines were forgotten in
wrestling with the immediate tribulation. The great
adventure was not what it had been cracked up
to be.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Among the bluejackets was a Princeton undergraduate,
Arthur Herbert Coffey, rating as a seaman,
whose misfortune it was to suffer serious
trouble with his eyes, so that he was sent home
shortly after the <em>Corsair</em> reached France. Later he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>entered the aviation service and died of influenza
on December 31, 1918, greatly mourned by his
former shipmates. He wrote, at some length, his
impressions of the voyage and so entertainingly
caught the spirit of it that he must be permitted to
tell you how they went rolling out to find the
“Bay of Biscay, O”:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall never forget the morning of June 14th as
long as I live. It was three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and very foggy when
our bos’n’s mate roused us from our hammocks and
told us to “rise and shine” as we were going to shove
off. I’ll admit that I had many fears and misgivings
at these harsh words, “shove off.” I had never been
out of sight of land before in my life, and to cross the
ocean on your first trip in a yacht three hundred feet
long seemed to me to be some adventure, just then.
Up to that time I hadn’t given it much thought. In
fact, I had been impatient for the event, like the rest
of the men, but as I was pulling on my socks that
morning (and three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> is a rotten time of day anyhow),
I began to reflect that perhaps I had been just
a little bit hasty in rushing into the war. And I couldn’t
help thinking how pleasant it would be to be snoring
in a good, soft bed at Princeton with nothing between
me and complete enjoyment of the day excepting a
ten-thirty recitation hour.</p>

<p>Well, I got dressed anyway and turned to. We
dropped down the river slowly and anchored off the
Battery, for the fog was so thick that you could hardly
see your hand before your face. All about us there was
the moaning of fog-horns and I felt forlorn inside. But
soon the fog lifted a bit and that, together with Bill
Rahill’s grin, made things feel a little bit better. “Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
we are off for the big stunt,” I said to myself. “I wonder
when we’ll see this old town again.”</p>

<p>I had the watch in the crow’s nest that afternoon,
from two to four, and enjoyed myself very much. It
had turned out to be a fine day, the sun was bright,
and we had lots of company, seven ships in all, four
transports, a cruiser, and two destroyers. After an
hour in the crow’s nest I happened to glance down at
the deck and noticed some very odd actions among
the crew. Several of them were leaning over the rail
and appeared to be staring very intently at something
in the water. I watched them for a while and then
suddenly it occurred to me that they were seasick.</p>

<p>I felt like a hardened old sailor, for here I was high
up in the crow’s nest, swaying from side to side, right
over the water, and in tip-top form with a husky appetite
for the next meal. I still felt fine when I climbed
down to the deck, but was too wise to kid anybody.
And it was a good thing I kept quiet, for an hour later
I was as miserable as the rest of them. We certainly
had a seasick crew for a couple of days. The green firemen
were so sick that they were unable to stoke properly
and we failed to keep up with the rest of our
convoy.</p>

<p>We kept dropping farther and farther behind, the
firemen still shy their sea-legs and also some of the
crew. Nobody saw the doctor and the paymaster for
four days.... Then the doctor made a brief appearance
in the sick-bay. He looked at a cut in a man’s
hand, clapped his own hand over his mouth, and we
didn’t see him again for two days more. But he came
around in fine shape after that, on the job every minute,
although he was not needed often, I am glad to
say.</p>

<p>To make a long story short, we abandoned all hope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
of staying with the first division and ploughed along
by ourselves for a few days, then picking up the second
group consisting of four transports and the same type
of escort. Everything went along smoothly for four
days and then our destroyers came out to meet us
from Queenstown. There were five of them and a
bully good sight they were to us who were getting
pretty close to the danger zone with our precious
transports. The destroyers came zipping up like gray
streaks and were on us almost before we knew it. We
stood on deck and cheered ourselves hoarse. They
were the boys who had gone over early, the first of the
Navy to see active service. They were glad to see us,
too, it appeared, and many messages were wig-wagged
back and forth. They fell into position and all hands
felt as safe as a church.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the afternoon of the next day,
I was below getting a drink of water when suddenly
there was a loud explosion. I remember that at the
time I thought somebody had dropped a hatch cover
directly over my head. I realized in a moment that it
was something else, for I heard loud shouts and the
tramp of feet on deck. I was topside in no time and
rushed for my gun as I was the loader of Number
Three gun.</p>

<p>The transports had all stopped. One of them, nearest
to us, was giving the submarine warning, a number of
blasts on her whistle which sounded uncanny to us
because it was the first time we had heard anything
from the transports since leaving New York. They
had moved across the ocean like so many ghosts. It
was a beautiful, clear day and the sea was as smooth
as a carpet.</p>

<p>I took my position at the gun, broke open a box of
ammunition, and laid hands on a shell. The doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
came rushing aft with a handful of cotton which he
told us to stuff in our ears. Then we were all set to be
torpedoed. I wasn’t scared—I was too busy, I guess—but
I was a little bit jumpy. I looked at my watch
and it was just five minutes of two. I wondered how
long it would take our yacht to sink after the torpedo
hit us.</p>

<p>The transports, as I have said, were making no headway
and were all grouped together like a flock of frightened
sheep, while the destroyers were just getting into
motion. This was one of the prettiest sights I ever saw.
No sooner had the transports halted than the destroyers,
six in all, darted out in a fan-shaped formation
and then worked back and forth, looking for all the
world like greyhounds on a scent. And maybe they
didn’t make knots! We were moving at top speed ourselves,
but those destroyers gave us the impression
that we were standing still. Zoom, one would cut across
our bow at about thirty knots, then another would
flash astern at the same rate.</p>

<p>For a time we could discover nothing else out of the
ordinary. Then suddenly the captain of Number Four
gun gave a yell and pointed astern. “There she goes!”
he shouted. “It’s a torpedo as sure as you live, or I
never saw one.” We all rubbered astern with our eyes
sticking out like onions, and there, sure enough, was a
wake foaming along at tremendous speed about fifty
yards away, but it was not heading in our direction,
thank goodness. I don’t know whether it was a torpedo
or not. I have never seen one, but our regular Navy
men swore it was.</p>

<p>The paymaster was sure it was, although he had
never seen one either, and he dashed up and down
the deck, clapping his hands and loudly exclaiming,
“Oh, it is a torpedo! It is a torpedo!” This relieved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
strain considerably. We all laughed until we almost
cried. The officer upon the after deck-house suddenly
cried out, “Stand steady, boys. Don’t get excited.
A school of porpoises is coming toward us.” We saw
them, and I imagine there would have been a heavy
mortality in that bunch of porpoises if the keen-eyed
officer had not warned us in time.</p>

<p>That was about all I saw of the submarine attack,
but I heard other stories from the deck and bridge.
The explosion at the outset had been caused by the
dropping of a depth charge from a destroyer, quite
close aboard the <em>Corsair</em>. No wonder I thought somebody
had banged a hatch cover over my head! The
firemen below thought we had been torpedoed and
were all for erupting on deck for a breath of fresh air.
That depth charge was powerful. Our men said they
saw the destroyer’s stern lift high in air while a great
spout of water leaped just astern. We saw oil smeared
over the water and I hope the destroyer was given
official credit for sinking a submarine.</p>

<p>One of our officers told me that more than one submarine
must have been in the attack, and that the
activity of the destroyer escort drove them off. There
was one incident which some of the men thought rather
a joke, but I felt sorry. In the morning an old British
tramp picked us up, and seeing all the destroyers, etc.,
concluded that we were good company to travel in,
so she stuck with us all the forenoon, keeping a mile
off to port. No sooner did she hear the submarine
warning than she lit out at full speed, about ten knots,
for safer waters. Two hours after that, our radio men
got an S.O.S. from her, that she had been torpedoed
and was sinking. It seemed too bad that we couldn’t
go and help her.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>This submarine alarm was the famous episode
which thrilled the American public as elaborated
by George Creel for the newspapers of July 4, 1917.
The <em>Corsair</em> witnessed only what occurred among
the second group of transports, and although some
of her men declared they saw the wake of a torpedo,
Commander Kittinger failed to confirm it in his
official report of this busy afternoon. Rear Admiral
Gleaves carefully considered the statements of the
officers of ships in Group Two and drew the following
conclusions, omitting the names of the vessels
engaged because of the naval censorship in force
at that time:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The H, leading the second group, encountered two
submarines, the first about 11.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, June 26th,
about a hundred miles off the coast of France, and the
second submarine two hours later. The I investigated
the wake of the first without further discovery. The
J<a id="FNanchor_3a" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> sighted the bow wave of the second at a distance
of 1500 yards and headed for it at a speed of twenty-five
knots. The gun pointers at the forward gun saw
the periscope several times for several seconds but it
disappeared each time before they could get on, due
to the zigzagging of the ship.</p>

<p>The J<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> passed about twenty-five yards ahead of a
mass of bubbles which were coming up from the wake
and let go a depth charge just ahead. Several pieces of
timber, quantities of oil, bubbles, and <em>débris</em> came to
the surface. Nothing more was seen of the submarine.
The attacks on the second group occurred about eight
hundred miles to the eastward of where the attacks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>had been made on the first group.... It appears from
reports of the French Ministry of Marine and from
the location of the attack that enemy submarines had
been notified of our approach and were probably
scouting across our route.</p>

<p>The story of Seaman Arthur Coffey is less exaggerated
than might have been expected in these
wholly novel circumstances. It may have been a
torpedo or, perchance, it was a porpoise that was
seen from the <em>Corsair</em>. If it was the latter, no blame
is to be laid to the young sailors who were so tremendously
excited. To their unaccustomed eyes the
ocean swarmed with periscopes and U-boats. Many
a seasoned skipper had blazed away at blackfish or
shivered in his shoes at a bit of floating spar. The
destroyer <em>Cummings</em>, at any rate, blew up something
from the vasty deep with the “ash can” that
plopped from her fan-tail. As for the soldiers packed
in the transports, all girdled with life-belts and eyeing
the ocean with morbid suspicion, they would
have told you that the submarines were coming at
them in droves. It was one of the dauntless doughboys
of this First Expeditionary Force who wrote
home to his trustful kindred:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">

<span class="smcap">Dear Mother and the Folks</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>We hadn’t more than got out of New York than you
could see submarines bobbing up all around us. The
periscopes were as thick as cat-tails in a swamp. I
counted seventy-five and then the ships began to fire.
The gunner near me fainted. Shell shock, I guess.
I sprang to the gun and began shooting. The first shot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
I fired hit a submarine square on top of the back and
tore out its whole back-bone, just like tearing out a
whale’s back-bone. There was blood all over the water,
and some oil.</p>

<p>I kept on shooting. I sank twelve of the submarines
myself. The battle lasted a good while and I heard that
fifty of the submarines had been destroyed. None of
us was killed. The submarines, what was left, finally
quit us. We haven’t seen any more of them. Give this
to the newspapers.</p>

<p>Love to all the folks, from your soldier boy</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Bill</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>At this early period of the naval war, the employment
of the depth charge as the most efficient
weapon against the submarine had not been fully
developed. The traditions of accurate gunfire as
the best offensive were not easily set aside. It was
true of the destroyers at Queenstown, as of these
yachts bound to France, that their crews felt sublimely
certain of smashing Fritz with the batteries
at which they drilled like so many skilled football
teams. Soon they came to realize, however, that the
chance of catching the enemy napping on the surface
was extremely remote and that shooting at
periscopes, even when they were not imaginary,
was futile business.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was armed with four three-inch
rifles, and their crews were very capably trained
under the direction of Ensign Schanze. This armament
was not heavy enough to match the guns of
a U-boat if the latter had been plucky enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
stand up to a duel, but it served to drive him under
and to inspire a wholesome respect. The superior
speed of the yacht made her particularly well
fitted for using depth charges, but at the outset
she was equipped with no more than ten of the
small and rather crude “Sperry mine” loaded
with from thirty to fifty pounds of TNT. This
device was exploded by means of a buoy and wire
cable which unwound as the steel canister plunged
through the water, releasing the detonator at the
proper depth. These mines frequently failed to
function and the destructive effect was feeble.</p>

<p>The Navy Department later perfected a terrific
“ash can” packed with three hundred pounds of
high explosive which was set off by means of a
hydrostatic valve and could be relied upon to
devastate a submarine a hundred feet below the
surface of the sea. These great bombs were dropped,
not one or two in an attack, but fairly dumped
overboard by the dozen or the score in a cataclysmic
barrage, after listening devices had located and
“fixed” the enemy. The “Y gun,” or twin mortar,
was also invented to hurl these metal kegs a considerable
distance from the ship. Such were the
perfected tactics learned from experience, which
would surely have doomed the U-boat to extinction
if the armistice had not intervened. The <em>Corsair</em>
was fitted out in this manner later in her service,
but she blithely sailed for the war zone with her
four small guns and a few “Sperry pills” and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
have felt no more pride in her task if she had been
a first-class battleship.</p>

<p>Concerning the voyage, Commander Kittinger
reported as follows, in the War Diary of the yacht:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Got under way at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, June 14th, and stood down
the river, anchoring at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> off Governor’s Island on
account of fog. Got under way again at 9.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Laid
to off Ambrose Light Vessel at 1.20 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Joined Group
No. 1 at 1.50 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and took departure from Ambrose
Light Vessel at 2.09 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, standard speed 12 knots.
At 2.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> weather became misty again which necessitated
closing in to keep the convoy in sight. The 4 to
8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> watch had difficulty in keeping steam for 12
knots. Blowers were used to assist. Ship lost distance
which was recovered in the next watch and position
maintained.</p>

<p>At 11.40 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the fog set in thick and lasted until
about 1.25 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, June 15th. At 3.20 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the convoy
was sighted on the port bow, distance four miles.
During the watch the ship logged over 12 knots by
revolutions of main engines, but due to deep draft was
unable to keep up. The blowers were run continually
to assist. The forward boiler could not be lighted off
as it was banked in with reserve coal supply. Between
4 and 5 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> while cleaning fires the speed by revolutions
dropped to 11 knots. A moderate sea was running
which caused seasickness among the firemen. The firemen
were drafted from the U.S.S. <em>Delaware</em> through
the receiving ship at New York and were unfamiliar
with firing Scotch boilers and not accustomed to the
quick and deep roll of small ships. Most of them became
useless during the cleaning fire period and their
places were taken by petty officers of the engine and
fire-room watch. The ship continued to lose distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
astern of convoy, a logged speed of 10½ knots being
maintained. I gave this matter my personal attention
and every effort was made to rejoin the convoy. From
noon to midnight an average speed of 11¾ knots
was logged. At 4.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the <em>Wilkes</em> came within hail
and made inquiries as to the cause of the <em>Corsair’s</em>
inability to keep in position.</p>

<p><em>June 16th.</em> An average speed of 10½ knots was
logged for the day. I found that the seasoned men,
most of them petty officers, were showing fatigue due
to the hard steaming qualities of the ship. A number
of volunteers from the deck force went below and
passed coal and handled ashes to assist. The reserve
coal from the dead fire-room was removed to allow
the forward boiler to be lighted off. Group No. 1 was
not seen this day. Group No. 2 was sighted astern at
3.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Lighted fires in boiler No. 1 at 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><em>June 17th.</em> Maintained about 11 knots (by revolutions).
Some of the firemen who had suffered from seasickness
were back at useful work and the ship had
become considerably lighter. At 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> cut in boiler
No. 1 and increased speed to 13 knots. Between 1 and
2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> two U.S. destroyers passed six miles to the
southward, one heading east and one west.</p>

<p><em>June 18th.</em> Averaged 13½ knots until 10.40 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
when speed was reduced to 10 knots to lose distance
and join Group No. 2.</p>

<p><em>June 19th.</em> Proceeding at reduced speed to allow
Group No. 2 to overhaul.</p>

<p><em>June 20th.</em> Proceeding at reduced speed, about 9
knots, to allow Group No. 2 to overhaul. It was desirable
to keep a speed that was low but economical to
get the mileage for the fuel.</p>

<p>June 21st. Proceeding at reduced speed, about 7
knots. At 3.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> sighted Group No. 2 on port<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
quarter,—distance four miles. Changed course to
intercept. At 5.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> took position on starboard
beam of <em>Henderson</em>, distance 2000 yards. At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
sighted U.S.S. <em>Maumee</em> and U.S.S. <em>Henley</em> on starboard
bow. The <em>Burrows</em> joined the <em>Maumee</em> and refueled.
At 8.22 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> stopped and lowered a boat and
boarded the <em>Birmingham</em> for orders. At 9.35 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> proceeded
in formation at 12 knots. Had no trouble in
keeping position from this time on with natural draft.
Zigzagged during the afternoon.</p>

<p><em>June 22nd and 23rd.</em> Proceeding with Group No. 2.
Zigzagged during daylight.</p>

<p><em>June 24th.</em> <em>Momus</em> broke out break-down flag and
dropped astern of formation. At 8.17 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> sighted three
destroyers one point on port bow. Five destroyers
joined escort during the morning.</p>

<p><em>June 25th.</em> Proceeding as before. At 5.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> steamed
at 14 knots. At noon steamed at 13 knots. Zigzagged
during daylight.</p>

<p><em>June 26th.</em> Proceeding with Group No. 2, steaming
at 13 knots. The U.S.S. <em>Cummings</em> let go a depth
charge at 2.00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> about 600 yards ahead. Manœuvred
for attack. Nothing sighted. Returned to formation.
Two French torpedo craft joined escort about 4 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p><em>June 27th.</em> Entered port during mid-watch. Anchored
during morning watch with 32 tons of coal remaining.
Arrived at Saint-Nazaire, France, with Group No. 2 of
Expeditionary Force.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>These were tired and grateful sailors aboard the
<em>Corsair</em>, for the slow-gaited transports, thirteen
days on the voyage, had caused continual anxiety
among the war vessels of the escort. The first group
had been attacked by submarines, as reported by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>Rear Admiral Gleaves, and it was an auspicious
omen that every ship and every soldier had been
carried across unharmed. The <em>Corsair</em> had been
compelled to drop back and join the second group,
but it was not her fault. As her skipper in former
days, Lieutenant Commander Porter was unhappy,
as you may imagine, although he knew
that the yacht would vindicate herself when in
proper trim and with a “black gang” that could
make steam and hold it.</p>

<p>Extra coal and stores had made the draft two
feet deeper than normal. One boiler-room was used
for coal stowage, but a speed of fourteen knots was
to be expected under these conditions. The firemen,
trained in a battleship, were green to their task
and were bowled off their pins by seasickness. It
indicated the spirit of the ship when the petty
officers, deck force and all, and as many other volunteers
as could find space to swing slice-bar and
shovel, toiled in the sultry heat of the furnaces
to shove the ship along. Never again was the Corsair
a laggard. Month after month on the Breton
Patrol or with the offshore convoys, the destroyers
were the only ships that could show their heels to
her.</p>

<p>The process of “shaking down,” of welding a
hundred and thirty men into a crew, and teaching
them what the Navy was like, had begun with the
hard routine at the docks in Hoboken and Brooklyn.
The voyage was the second lesson and it wonderfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
helped to hammer home the doctrines of
team-work and morale, of cheerful sacrifice and
ready obedience. Those who grumbled repented of
it later and held it as a privilege that they were permitted
to play the great game. It was while they
sweltered to make more steam and urge the ship to
greater speed that an Irish stoker expressed himself
as follows:</p>

<p>“I have heard tell of the meltin’-pot, but ’tis
me first experience with it. Hotter than hell wid
the lid off, and ye can see thim all meltin’, and will
ye listen to the names of the brave American lads,
Brillowski, Schlotfeldt, Aguas, and Teuten that
signed on to juggle the coal. An’ will ye pipe off the
true-blue Yankee sailors, Haase, and Skolmowski,
Fusco, Kaetzel, and Balano, not to mintion such
good old Anglo-Saxon guys as De Armosolo,
Thysenius, and Wysocki. I will make no invidjous
distinctions, but what kind of a fightin’ ship would
this be if ye hadn’t Gilhooley, Mullins, Murphy,
Mulcahy, Egan, Sullivan, and Flynn? The meltin’-pot!
’Tis a true word. An’ may the domned old
Kaiser sizzle in a hotter place, if there is wan.”</p>

<p>One of the boyish bluejackets noted his own
change of heart in a diary which contained such
entries as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>June 19th.</em> At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we sighted an empty lifeboat.
Don’t know where it came from, as there was no name.
We also saw two objects floating quite far off and
thought they were corpses, but were not sure....<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Stood two watches and had an abandon ship drill and
gun practice. Wrote some letters, but don’t know when
we can mail them. Sighted a big whale not fifty yards
from the ship. It scared me. I was at the wheel and
thought it was a submarine. Sleeping in my bunk for
the first time since leaving New York.</p>

<p><em>21st.</em> We are having a typical northeaster and the
ship is burying her rails in the sea now and then. We
have joined the second group of the fleet. It consists
of the <em>Birmingham</em>, four transports, a destroyer, ourselves,
and the <em>Aphrodite</em>.... <em>22nd.</em> The northeaster is
still on in full blast and the sea is running high. We
hope to reach France Tuesday. The food and the life
on this ship are pretty bad, and when this war is over
and I sign off I shall devoutly thank God.</p>

<p><em>23rd.</em> A pretty bad day all round. High sea, rain,
and fog. We are now in the war zone and zigzagging
back and forth across the ocean. The <em>Birmingham</em> has
kept us busy all day with signals. The ship has been
very hard to steer and I am tired out. Broke a filling
out of my tooth and it hurts. Hope I will get a chance
to have it fixed in France. A toothache out here would
certainly be bad. Have been unable to take a bath for
a week. Am washing in a bucket of water.</p>

<p><em>24th.</em> Another day of nasty weather. The mid-watch
was the worst I ever stood. The fog was awful and
when I was at the wheel we almost rammed the
<em>Antilles</em>. We also dodged two suspicious-looking steel
drums that looked very much like mines.... <em>25th.</em> Our
coal is getting low and we will surely land some time
to-morrow morning. I wish I could talk French. Everybody
is writing letters home to-day. Stood a terrible
watch with Mr. Tod on the bridge. He and Captain
Kittinger took turns bawling me out. I almost rammed
a destroyer twice by obeying orders to the letter, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
the officers were in a bad temper and blamed me. Gad,
but I’ll be glad to set foot on dry land.</p>
</div>

<p>Somewhat later this same young man was jotting
down:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whoever reads this diary will probably notice my
changed attitude toward what we have to put up with.
What seemed unbearable a few months ago amounts
to nothing, now that we have become hardened to all
things. I have read the whole diary through and
laughed at my early grouches.</p>
</div>

<p>And so the <em>Corsair</em> came to France and rested in
the quaint old port of Saint-Nazaire while her men
beheld the troops of Pershing’s First Division
stream down the gangways and receive a welcome
thrilling beyond words, the cheers and outstretched
hands, the laughter and the tears of a people who
hailed these tall, careless fighting men as crusaders
come to succor them. This was a sight worth seeing
and remembering. And when the American sailors
went ashore there was an ovation for them, flowers
and kisses and smiles, and if such courtesies were
bestowed upon the bluejackets of the <em>Corsair</em>, they
gallantly returned them, it is quite needless to
say.</p>

<p>Seven of the crew were granted liberty for a
hasty trip to Paris. Seaman Arthur Coffey was in
the party and his written impressions convey a
glimpse of what it meant to these young Americans
to come into contact with the sombre realities of
the struggle which France was enduring with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
back to the wall. It surprised and amused them to
find the American infantrymen already so much at
home in Saint-Nazaire that their liveliest interest
was in shooting craps at the street corners:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here were soldiers and sailors who had just crossed
an ocean full of hidden terrors [observed Arthur Coffey],
and most of them were to face worse terrors later on,
but did they consider these things? Not for a minute!
They had money in their pockets and beer under their
belts and this “spiggoty” currency, as they called the
wads of paper notes, made them feel like millionaires.
The marines had not arrived to police the streets, so
they rattled the dice in crowds. For all they saw or
cared, they might have been in their own home towns,
perfectly indifferent to their surroundings. The French
onlookers were different. They were appraising these
new comrades-in-arms, whispering among themselves,
admiring the equipment and the rugged stature of
these soldiers from beyond the seas. We watched the
fun until it was time to find the train for Paris and
moved away with cries of, “Shoot the cinq-froncs,”
“Fade him for a cart-wheel, Bill,” “Come on, you
baby,” ringing in our ears.</p>

<p>We got aboard the right train with the kind assistance
of a French lady who interpreted for us. It was
great luck to get the seventy-two-hour leave, and the
crowd was congenial, five men from Princeton, one
from Yale, and one from Cornell. The trip to Paris
was lengthy because we had to travel second class and
sit up all night, being Navy gobs and not officers. The
French took us for plain, ordinary bluejackets and
fraternized at once. Their style of opening a conversation
was to sit and look at you for a time, smile, and
then having attracted your attention, with a terrifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
grimace ejaculate: “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le boche, ah-h-h-k!</i>” drawing a hand
across the throat. This done they would beam expectantly
and, needless to say, we responded with grimaces
even more terrifying and repeated the formula. Having
mutually slit the gullet of the hated foe, I would add,
to show off my French, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n’aime pas le boche!</i>”
Then the way was opened for a conversation.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parlez-vous français, monsieur?</i>” “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais un peu,
monsieur</i>,” I would say, and then bang away with the
stereotyped sentence, “I have studied French two
years at school and I can understand the language
pretty well, but I cannot speak it.” As soon as my
friend, the French soldier, heard me rip off this sentence
he would open his eyes and say, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Parlez bien
français, monsieur</i>” and then start talking so fast that
I could not understand a word, and this would be the
end of the conversation, on my part, at least.</p>

<p>Some of my companions, however, were even worse
performers than I. Poor old Bill Rahill, who was in
my class in college, had taken economic courses and
so knew no modern languages. All he could say was
“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui</i>” and “Non comprenny, monsieur,” at which I
would nudge him and ask if it were not better, perhaps,
to have a little culture and know something
about a foreign language than to be cluttered up with
the Malthusian theory or some other rot like that.</p>

<p>We had a great time on that train to Paris. At the
first long stop almost everybody got out and went into
the waiting-room, or saloon, and bought various refreshments.
We had seen no grass or green trees for
two weeks, so we piled out and made for the beautiful
lawn near the station. We rolled on the grass and
sniffed the pine trees. We were like cats that had been
shy of catnip for a long time. I suppose the French
people thought we were crazy, but we didn’t care, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>it certainly did feel good to have the green earth under
our feet again.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Then we wandered into the restaurant and loaded up
with cheese and a couple of yards of war bread, and
one of the fellows bought several bottles of champagne
at a ridiculously low price. Thus armed, we climbed
into the train where we met two French soldiers who
were returning to the trenches. They let us try on their
helmets and gas-masks and they spoke a little English,
so with plenty of gestures we got on very well. They
said they knew we were Americans because we talked
through our noses. We took that good-naturedly, but
I noticed that my brother gobs began to speak way
down in their throats right after that. We chewed on
the war bread and washed it down with champagne.
That is a great breakfast combination, you can take
my word for it. And then some one piped up a song.
“Buck” Bayne, Yale 1914, was handy at fitting words
to college airs and we soon had a fine concert going.
One of the ditties, I remember, went like this, to the
tune of “Cheer for Old Amherst”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Good-night, poor U-boats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">U-boats, good-night!</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">When the U.S. fleet gets after you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3"><em>Kaiser, good-night</em>!!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Before long we had a crowd around that train compartment
that you couldn’t get through to save your
neck. The Frenchmen all applauded the <em>Corsair</em> glee
club and yelled for more, but we felt too conspicuous
and so we persuaded the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poilus</i> to sing some funny
trench songs, which we couldn’t understand, but we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
laughed and slapped them on the back as though we
knew every word.</p>

<p>Next morning we arrived in Paris, and, with a few
other men from our ship, were the first American sailors
in that city since our country had declared war. You
can imagine what that meant to us, how the people
greeted us with cordial affection and kindness. Thank
God, the Frenchmen did not try to kiss us! If the Paris
girls had insisted, we should have submitted like
gentlemen. We put up at the Hotel Continental, and
were more than amused at the expressions on the
faces of several dignified English officers when they
saw seven common bluejackets of the American Navy
blow in and eat breakfast next to them.</p>

<p>That day we ran into lots of friends who were in
the American Field Ambulance Service, attached to the
French Army, and they told us gloomy tales about the
war outlook. They said the Russians were through,
that the French were literally shot to pieces, and that
the job of finishing the war was up to us. Imagine it—I,
who had hoped in May that the Russians would
keep on retreating so that I could get a chance to see
the show before it was over, was now wishing that the
war would end. I have seen the light since that day.
We fellows were really feeling the war for the first
time when we noticed that the streets of Paris were
filled with crippled men and with women in mourning.</p>

<p>We spent two busy days in mixing with soldiers of
all nations and doing Paris. The troops who impressed
us most, even more than the French, and that is going
some, were the Canadians. They gave us such a rousing
welcome that it was like being home again. They were
so glad to see us that they almost wrapped themselves
around our necks. “Hello, Jack,” was their invariable
greeting. “How are things over in the States?” “It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
sure good to see you.” “When are your troops coming
over?” “What, you came across with some of them?”
“The devil you say!” “Well, all I hope is that they
give us a chance to fight alongside the Yanks. We’ll
go through Fritz so fast that he won’t know what hit
him.”</p>

<p>While we were knocking about Paris with the
Canadians, our money was no good. They insisted on
buying us drinks, cigarettes, and acted as interpreters.
There was nothing they wouldn’t do for us. Our spirits
began to rise at once. We asked them about all the
pessimistic rumors. Were they true? “Hell, no,” said
they. “Why, there’s nothing to it. Shell ’em a bit, then
shell ’em some more, and when you go over the top,
Fritz just sticks up his hands and yells that he’s your
kamerad.” “As soon as he sees the cold steel, up goes
his bloody hands,” one little chap confided to me. And
he had such a look in his eye when he said it that I think
my blooming hands would have been up if he had said
the word.</p>

<p>They were the most confident lot of men I ever saw.
This was the first visit to Paris for most of them. They
had been out there for two years, getting leave only
among the little villages back of the line, but they
didn’t seem to mind going back to the trenches. And
they were always talking about the war and their
campaigns. The soldiers of other nations seemed fed
up with it, but not so with the Canadians. Why, I
heard two of them, a private and a captain, in a heated
argument across a table as to how they could capture
Lens without letting the Germans destroy the coal
mines. The private leaned over and poked the captain
in the stomach to emphasize a point, and the captain
tried to out-shout his companion. One would have
thought them to be a couple of privates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of the third day we left Paris for
our port. Dave Tibbott, a classmate of mine, practiced
talking French to a lad in the train, and Bill Rahill
said “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oui</i>” and “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà</i>” to a pretty girl who shared
the compartment. She seemed to be partial to Bill’s
smile, for we all had him beaten on slinging the French.
When she left the train, Bill helped her out and kissed
her hand by way of farewell. When we kidded him
about it, he defended himself on the ground that they
did such things in France and one must follow the
customs of the country.</p>

<p>We had many yarns to spin when we boarded our
ship and we were careful to tell the boys about the
fine baths in the hotel, although we omitted the fact
that there was no hot water. When we described the
wonderful soft beds, it looked as though there might
be a lot of desertions from the <em>Corsair</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>I saw many interesting sights during my stay in
French waters, but my eyes went bad and they put me
ashore where I stayed a month and a half waiting for
a ship to take me home. I was finally sent back to the
United States in August and, to my great sorrow, received
a medical discharge. The life is hard in the Navy
in the war zone, harder than anything I had ever done
before, but I would give ten years of my life to have
been able to stick it out with the boys on the old
<em>Corsair</em> and do my share.</p>

<span class="fs80">AT SEA WITH THE BRETON PATROL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> the <em>Corsair</em> arrived on the French
coast there was nothing to indicate the vast
American organization, military and naval, which
was soon to be created with a speed and efficiency
almost magical. Supply bases, docks, fuel stations,
railroads were, at the outset, such as France could
provide from her own grave necessities. Marshal
Joffre and Lord Balfour had convinced the Government
at Washington that if the United States delayed
to prepare, it might be too late. Troops were
demanded, above all else. Man power was the vital
thing. And so these early divisions were hurried
overseas to Pershing with little more than the
equipment on their backs.</p>

<p>The Navy was aware of its own share of the
problem which was to extend its fighting front to
the shores of France as well as to the Irish Sea. To
protect the ocean traffic to and from the United
States, small, swift ships were required by the
dozens and scores, but they could not be built in
a day, and, as a British admiral expressed it, “This
rotten U-boat warfare had caught all the Allies
with their socks down.” Of the naval escort with
the First Expeditionary Force, the cruisers returned
to the United States for further convoy duty and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the destroyers went either with them or were ordered
to join the flotilla at Queenstown. For a short
time the <em>Corsair</em> and another large yacht, the
<em>Aphrodite</em>, were left to comprise the American naval
strength on the French coast. On June 30th, Commander
Kittinger received the following instructions
from Rear Admiral Gleaves:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When in all respects ready for sea, proceed with the
vessel under your command to Brest, France, and
report to the Senior French Naval Officer for duty.
Exhibit these orders to the Senior United States Naval
Officer in Brest. Upon the arrival of Captain W. B.
Fletcher, U.S. Navy, report to him for duty.</p>
</div>

<p>The tenor of these orders indicated the wise and
courteous policy which Vice-Admiral Henry B.
Wilson was later to develop with brilliant success—that
of coöperation with and deference to the
French naval authorities instead of asserting the
independence of command which, in fact, he exercised.
At this time Captain Fletcher had been appointed
to organize the American “Special Patrol
Force,” and he was daily expected to arrive in the
yacht <em>Noma</em>. The ancient port of Brest was selected
as the chief naval base because the French had
long used it for this purpose, maintaining dockyards,
repair shops, and arsenals, and also because
the largest transports afloat could be moored in
its deep and spacious harbor. Saint-Nazaire and
Bordeaux became the great entry ports for cargo
steamers during the war, while into Brest the huge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>liners carried twenty thousand or forty thousand
troops in a single convoy.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> steamed into Brest on July 2d in
company with the <em>Aphrodite</em> and duly reported to
Vice-Admiral Le Brise, of the French Navy. Two
days later a fleet of other yachts arrived from home
and were warmly welcomed, the <em>Noma</em>, <em>Kanawha</em>,
<em>Harvard</em>, <em>Christabel</em>, <em>Vidette</em>, and <em>Sultana</em>. With this
ambitious little navy it was possible to operate a
patrol force which Captain Fletcher promptly proceeded
to do, acting in concert with the French
torpedo boats, armed trawlers, submarines, and
aircraft.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> lay in port ten days to coal, paint
ship, and otherwise prepare for the job of cruising
in the Bay of Biscay. An unofficial log, as kept by
one of the seamen, briefly notes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>July 2nd.</em> Sailed for Brest from Saint-Nazaire at
4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Arrived at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and received four submarine
warnings on the way. We thought we saw two periscopes,
but they may have been buoys. We have added
a French pilot to our crew. No shore liberty, as we are
too tired. We hear we are to be over here a long time,
with Brest as our base.</p>

<p><em>July 3rd.</em> I spent the day painting the bridge. The
ship looks fine. I am also standing a twelve-hour watch
in order to give the other signal-men shore liberty.
We caught a bunch of mackerel over the side to-day
and will fry them. The <em>Aphrodite</em> has challenged us to
row them a race to-morrow. A big French dirigible
went out to sea to look for submarines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p><em>July 4th.</em> A national holiday, but not for us. We won
the race from the <em>Aphrodite</em>. The <em>Noma</em> and the <em>Kanawha</em>
arrived this morning. They fought a submarine,
but no damage was done on either side. We expect to
get under way any minute and will look for the U-boat
that shot at the <em>Noma</em>. We had water sports in the
afternoon and they were good fun.</p>

<p><em>July 5th.</em> The <em>Sultana</em> arrived to-day. She picked up
all the survivors of the S.S. <em>Orleans</em> which was torpedoed
on the 3rd. Five of them were put aboard this
ship and their description of the sinking was harrowing.
Only two lifeboats got away. Four men were killed.
The ship sank in ten minutes. According to the dope,
the <em>Corsair</em> will sink in three minutes, if struck. Cheerful,
what?</p>

<p><em>July 6th.</em> This was my first liberty in Brest. It is a
very old town high on the cliffs. We went through the
Duke of Brittany’s old castle which dates back some
fifteen hundred years and was once the homestead of
Anne of Brittany. The dungeons were mighty interesting.
They surely did treat ’em rough in those days.
These rooms are more than two hundred feet down in
the solid rock and have been dark for ages. I should
call them unhealthy. The tortures they used to inflict
on the prisoners were diabolical. And yet you’ll hear
gobs growling about the Navy. All of which reminds
me that life on shipboard has been running along without
much change. Several Russian destroyers came
into the harbor this afternoon.</p>

<p><em>July 7th.</em> A lot more of the men got Paris liberty to-day.
We had a bad little accident on board. The hook
at the bow of the small motor sailer pulled out when
the boat was suspended about forty feet above the
water. It fell and three men working in it were spilled
into the drink. Mr. Mason, assistant engineer, struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
his back and head and was badly bruised.... <em>9th.</em> I
certainly will be glad when the other signal-men get
back from Paris. These twelve-hour watches are wearing
me out. There are two rumors—one that we are
to go to sea again for three days, put in at Saint-Nazaire,
out again three days, and then back. The
other rumor is that we are going to England. I hope
this is correct. This is the first time I have felt homesick,
and for some reason to-night I do. I guess it is
because poor old Art Coffey is to be shipped back to
the States. His eye trouble can’t be treated over here.
Nothing has happened aboard ship excepting that the
commander told Art that the <em>Corsair</em> would not go
back home for a long, long time, if he could help it.
Golly, but I would like to go; not to stay, but just to
get a glimpse of home and the folks.</p>

<p><em>July 13th.</em> Spent the morning washing my white
clothes. A new rumor! We are to leave here Saturday
for five days, put into Queenstown for coal and then
back to the States, spend a couple of weeks there and
then convoy the National Guardsmen or more of the
Regular Army back. I hope this is true. How I would
like to see a real country again. France is beautiful,
but dead. Brest is no livelier than Edgartown and there
is only one Paris. Its name is New York. This was
Friday, the 13th, so I was mighty careful to watch my
step. To-morrow is the French Fourth of July and it is
a big fête day. Wish I were going ashore to see the
celebration. Met some Yale men off the <em>Harvard</em> and
they are very nice chaps. I am improving on the
blinker signals and feel encouraged. No more dope!</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> sailed next day on her first patrol
cruise, and the author of the foregoing observations
affords us a glimpse of what the job seemed like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
while they were becoming hardened to it. He goes
on to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>July 15th.</em> At sea. A cold, rough day. I feel a bit
shaky and have a sore throat. Our work out here is
answering S.O.S. calls, looking for submarines, and
convoying merchant ships. We convoyed one Dane
and two Britishers most of the day. One of the Limies
had swapped shots with a sub.... No chance to take
off my clothes or wash. Took a practice shot at a barrel
and hit it at half a mile.... <em>17th.</em> Ran over a submarine
at 2.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> but could not get a shot at it. This
trip has been awful weather most of the time, rain,
mist, wind, and fog. Nothing is dry on the whole ship.
Anybody that says life in the Navy is a cinch has
never been in it. If this war lasts a year we shall all be
changed men.</p>

<p><em>July 20th.</em> Back at Brest. The <em>Harvard</em> came in with
survivors of two torpedoed ships. One crew had been
blown up twice within twenty-four hours. They had
been picked up and then the rescuing ship was sunk.
The submarine took the captain and the gunner along
as prisoners.... <em>21st.</em> At sea. This has been a very
exciting day. We have seen three submarines. We fired
at one periscope and either hit it or near it. When the
splash cleared away the submarine had disappeared.
We were at our battle stations almost all day. We
passed a great deal of wreckage, some of it barrels of
oil and gasoline. Also passed an upset lifeboat with
two masts and a beautiful big life-raft. We always
cruise around such objects before approaching them,
as they may be submarine bait. I stood the midnight
watch and sighted a light which we headed towards.
It turned out to be a large American schooner, deserted
and on fire. The masts were gone and it was a complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
wreck. We met a British Naval Reserve ship bound to
Africa, a funny-looking craft for ocean work, flat-bottomed
with side wheels.</p>

<p><em>July 23rd.</em> To-day we had lots of excitement. In my
watch I discovered an object five miles off which looked
exactly like a periscope. I sounded the alarm and we
approached it very carefully. It turned out to be a
large piece of wreckage with a ventilator on top. More
empty lifeboats to-day, and no clew to tell where they
came from. At night Captain Kittinger sighted a
strange ship which he swore was a submarine. It proved
to be a British destroyer and the joke was on the
skipper.</p>

<p><em>July 26th.</em> In port. To-day as per our weekly schedule
we coaled ship with the usual results. Filth and coal
dust everywhere. Instead of coaling I had to stand a
twelve-hour signal watch. In sending a semaphore
message to the <em>Vidette</em> I was nearly killed. A Spanish
freighter was between the two ships and I had to climb
into the rigging about fifty feet above the deck. As I
could not hold on with either hand, only with my feet,
it was ticklish work. I slipped and started to fall, but
luckily caught hold of the rigging in time and saved
myself. It was too close for comfort. A torpedo missed
the <em>Noma</em> by ten feet. Wow!</p>

<p><em>July 27th.</em> Sailed this morning to meet and escort
U.S. troop-ships. The <em>Aphrodite</em> is supposed to be with
us, but she blew a boiler tube and has gone back. We
had a pretty close shave this afternoon. Ran into a
mine field, but zigzagged through it and, thank God,
dodged them all. A mine would blow every one of us
to kingdom come without a chance to get a boat over....
<em>29th.</em> Left the transports we were convoying at
Saint-Nazaire and then put out to patrol our regular
area. Escorted several ships to-day, most of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
British. One of the Limies was an awful bonehead and
when we demanded to know his nationality he showed
no colors. We hoisted our battle flag at the fore, but he
came to and ran up his ensign just as we were about to
throw a shot across his bow. We convoyed a big Cunarder,
the <em>Tuscania</em>, carrying mail and supplies from
America to Falmouth and dropped her at the end of
our patrol area. Our Queenstown destroyers probably
picked her up after we left her.... <em>31st.</em> Early this
morning a Greek steamer got mixed in her bearings
and nearly ran into us. We had to stop and back at
full speed. This is the roughest day I have ever seen
on the ocean. The waves are half as high as the mast.
We are shipping water almost constantly and it is
dangerous to walk on deck.</p>

<p><em>August 2nd.</em> Left Saint-Nazaire convoying the
<em>Bohemian</em>. This is the largest cargo ship afloat, and it is
quite a feather in our cap to be given the escort duty.
The roughest sea yet and it is impossible to enter our
compartment below. Almost everybody seasick. A big
wave carried away our hatch ventilator and mess gear
last night with a terrible crash. I was asleep, and when
the noise came and the water poured down on us I
thought we were sinking. I grabbed my life-preserver
and started for my station, but got word that all was
well, so went back to my bunk. It was soaked, with
six inches of water on the deck under me, but I slept
anyhow.</p>

<br>

<p><em>August 15th.</em> Convoying the <em>Celtic</em>. We had been at
sea only two hours when the fo’castle began shipping
water which lavishly deluged the “hell-hole” below,
as usual. I slept in the motor sailer and got wet, as
usual. It rained on me all night and all I had was one
blanket. My clothes dried out in the wind.... Left
the <em>Celtic</em> and started for Brest. Got an S.O.S. call and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>headed for it. Found three ships there, but no sign of
a torpedoed vessel. I understand that she was not sunk,
but got away under her own steam. I slept in a boat
again. Couldn’t stand it below decks. Hear we coal to-morrow
and put to sea again at night. Hope it’s a lie.</p>

<p><em>August 19th.</em> Got liberty after coaling ship and went
ashore. Was hungry, so bought quite a dinner—one
omelette, two steaks, two orders of peas and potatoes,
tomato salad, three plates of ice-cream, five small
cakes, two peaches, coffee, and some champagne.
Wasn’t at all hungry when I got through. The life
begins to agree with me.</p>
</div>

<p>It may be noted that in these extracts from the
day’s routine of several weeks of active duty, the
<em>Corsair</em> was engaged in patrolling a certain definite
area of ocean and in escorting single ships through
her block, like a policeman on a beat, or in saving
mariners and vessels in distress. Incidentally she
endeavored to lift the scalp of Fritz whenever opportunity
offered. These areas, as laid off on the chart
in degrees of latitude and longitude, would measure
perhaps sixty by one hundred miles. The same
system was employed by the Queenstown destroyer
flotilla during the early months of its service. Some
protection was given shipping and the submarines
were driven farther offshore, but as an offensive
campaign the patrol system was a little better than
nothing. Of the destroyer patrol, Admiral Sims had
this to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The idea is sound enough if you can have destroyers
enough. We figured that to make the patrol system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
work with complete success, we should have to have
one destroyer for every square mile. The area of the
destroyer patrol off Queenstown comprised about
25,000 square miles. In other words, the complete protection
of the trans-Atlantic trade would have required
about 25,000 destroyers.</p>
</div>

<p>The alternative and by far the more effective
scheme was to group a number of merchant vessels
or transports and send them out from port or take
them in with a sufficient force of destroyers and
yachts to screen the convoy from submarine attack.
Valuable ships could not be allowed to run by themselves.
This was the procedure worked out and
generally adopted after the United States had come
into the war, and it made possible the enormous
task of placing two million men in France and
feeding a large part of Europe besides.</p>

<p>When the <em>Corsair</em> was on the Breton patrol, in
company with other American yachts, it was difficult
to realize how few U-boats were actually cruising
at one time and how great were the odds against
finding one in a designated patrol area.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now in this densely packed shipping area [declared
Admiral Sims], extending, say, from the north of
Ireland to Brest, there were seldom more than eight
or ten submarines operating at any one time. The largest
number I had record of was fifteen, but this was
exceptional. The usual number was four, six, eight, or
perhaps ten. We estimated that the convoys and troop-ships
brought in reports of sighting about three hundred
submarines for every submarine actually in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
field. We also estimated that for every hundred submarines
the Germans possessed, they could keep only
ten or a dozen at work in the open sea. Could Germany
have kept, let us say, fifty submarines constantly at
work on the great shipping routes in the winter and
spring of 1917, before we had learned how to handle
the situation, nothing could have prevented her from
winning the war. Instead of sinking 850,000 tons in
a single month, she would have sunk 2,000,000 or 3,000,000
tons.</p>
</div>

<p>With such handicaps it was all the more creditable
to the <em>Corsair</em> and her sister yachts that they
were able to accomplish so much in the summer of
1917, before they were shifted to the troop and
supply convoys. It was knight-errantry, in a way,
this work of the Breton Patrol—rough-riders of
the sea whose spirit was akin to that of the impetuous
regiment which Theodore Roosevelt led at
Santiago. The Breton pilots were eloquent in admiration,
but shrugged their shoulders at the notion of
weathering a Bay of Biscay winter in these yachts,
so slender, so elegant, of such light construction,
of a certainty built for pleasure and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le sport</i>!</p>

<p>The programme of patrol duty sent the larger
yachts out two and two, each pair to be relieved
after four days at sea. The <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em>
were coupled as cruising in adjoining areas, and
when they returned to port the <em>Noma</em> and <em>Kanawha</em>
went out to take the same stations. The smaller
yachts of the “Suicide Fleet” were assigned areas
nearer the Breton coast, where they guarded the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
shipping that flowed alongshore between the Channel
and the ports of France and Spain. The Patrol
Instructions included the following plan of operation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When on an area patrol, vessels shall steer courses
to cover the area but the method adopted must be
irregular. Do not proceed with such regularity that
the vessel’s position may be plotted.</p>

<p>When on a line patrol, vessels shall proceed along
the line of patrol until reaching its extremity when a
return over the same line will be made. The courses
steered must be such that the advance of the vessel
will be along the <em>base course</em>.</p>

<p>When on patrol, vessels shall speak all ships sighted.
Obtain the following information:</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair’s</em> log-book and the official War
Diary, which was sent as a record to the Navy
Department, are so laconic and technical that one
might conclude the Breton Patrol to be lacking in
all adventure. They serve to check up the yarns
spun by the crew, however, and have the merit of
accuracy. Omitting the daily entries of courses,
position, and speed which could interest nobody,
the commander’s record of the first cruise out of
Brest reads like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

deal of smoke.</p>

French destroyers, escorting cargo ships. Intercepted

<p>Two more cruises were made in the month of
July, but they furnished no thrilling episodes beyond
the discovery of the burning American
schooner <em>Augustus Weld</em> which, no doubt, had been
shelled by a U-boat. What had become of her crew
was left to conjecture. This noble four-master was
one of many Yankee sailing vessels which dared
the war zone, tempted by the chance of fabulous
profits, until the War Risk Board refused to grant
them insurance. The easiest marks in the world for
submarines, they loafed along in infested waters, at
the whim of the fickle winds, or drifted becalmed
with towering canvas that was visible for many
miles. Some of them were sailed by sun-dried skippers
from Maine and Cape Cod who vowed they
“would take her to hell and repeat if the bonus
was big enough.” The episode of the blazing, derelict
schooner profoundly impressed the crew of the
<em>Corsair</em>. It was their first glimpse of the heartless
havoc of the U-boat.</p>

<p>They were learning that the service in the war
zone was not all adventure and exhilaration, but,
for the most part, monotonous toil and discomfort,
just as the soldier in the trenches had found it out
for himself. To be wet and cold and slung about in
a rolling ship, to return to port and shovel coal
until almost ready to go to sea again—this was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
to be their lot month after month. The danger of it
was always present, but they soon became cheerfully
indifferent. It went without saying that at the
explosion of a torpedo the yacht would fly apart
like a box of matches, but these young men snored
soundly in their uneasy bunks until the cruel boatswain’s
mate bade them “show a leg” or “rise and
shine.”</p>

<p>With the elasticity of the American spirit they
adjusted themselves to this new manner of life and
to the ways of the Navy. Their language suffered
an extraordinary sea change. They talked the lingo
of the bluejacket, which is not so much slang as a
strong and racy sort of expression. The officers were
called “bolo-men” because they adorned themselves
with swords on official occasions. One spoke
of the ship’s cooks as “food destroyers,” or “belly
robbers,” which was sometimes unjust. To pipe
down for mess, or the call to meals, was shortened
to “chow down,” and the meal pennant was the
“bean rag.” “A hash mark” had nothing to do
with food, but was the service stripe on a sailor’s
sleeve.</p>

<p>A “canary” was a man who slept in a hammock
instead of a bunk, and when he got up in the morning
he “hit the deck.” The <em>Corsair</em> never departed
from port, but always “shoved off,” and when her
crew was granted liberty they “hit the beach.” Instead
of putting on clean clothes they “broke them
out.” This phrase was used in so many ways that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>a boyish seaman whose best girl had discarded him
for a doughboy was heard to confide that he “had
broke out a pippin of a new one.”</p>

<p>The period of enlistment was a “hitch” or a
“cruise.” The depth charges were seldom called
such, but figured as “mines,” “ash cans,” or
“battle-bricks,” and the deck upon which they were
carried was always “topside.” Almost any foreigner
was a “Spic,” barring the Briton who was always
a “Limey.” The yeomen, gunner’s mates, and
quartermasters of the <em>Corsair</em> were “politicians,”
which slurred their habits of industry. “Four bells”
meant to move rapidly, and the weary sailor did
not fall asleep, but “calked off.” At the mess table
it might divert a landsman to see the catsup bottle
pass in reply to a request for the “red lead,” or to
hear, “Put a fair wind behind the lighthouse” when
the salt cellar was desired.</p>

<p>During these early months of foreign service,
both the morals and the morale of a ship’s company
were bound to be tested. Jack ashore was traditionally
presumed to take the town apart to see what
made it tick. But this was a different navy, just as
the American Army was to set new standards of
behavior and self-respect. Among the crew of the
<em>Corsair</em> were all sorts and conditions of youth released
from the restraints of home ties and subjected
to all the demoralizing influences which
must ever go hand-in-hand with war. It was a saying
among troops freshly landed, when they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
inclined to run riot, that France had gone to their
heads, and there was something in the excuse.</p>

<p>It was most noteworthy that the conduct of the
sailors of the American naval forces was everywhere
commendable, whether ashore in Brittany,
or at Queenstown, or with the Grand Fleet at Edinburgh.
They were, in a sense, on honor to acquit
themselves as became the flag and the uniform,
and in character, intelligence, and upbringing a
large percentage of them represented the best blood
of the United States. This was true of the <em>Corsair</em>
and also typical of the other ships manned by the
Naval Reserve Force on the coast of France.</p>

<p>Shore liberty at Brest was diverting as a respite
from the crowded ship and its routine, but the
novelty was soon dispelled. It was picturesque and
colorful to ramble in the Rue de Siam where the
soldiers and sailors of many races jostled each other,
but until the Y.M.C.A. established its social centre
in the port there was not much else to do than eat
and loaf and drink white wine and red. Of the three
days in port, coaling ship consumed so much time
and energy that leisure hours ashore were brief.
There was no coaling machinery at this important
French naval base, and the American yachts had
the back-breaking job of filling baskets from barges
alongside and heaving the fuel aboard to be stowed
in the bunkers. The grimy slaves of the shovel
envied the Queenstown destroyers when these
smart, immaculate craft tarried to fill their fuel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
tanks with oil by inserting a hose in the deck and
then fled back to their own base.</p>

<p>Among the songs inspired by the day’s work it is
no wonder that the fo’castle or the “black gang”
quartets should have led the close harmony in
such stentorian plaints as the following:</p>

<p>There were temptations enough, Heaven knows,
to live recklessly when the liberty boats hit the
beach, but the <em>Corsair’s</em> record was excellent and
her officers were proud of it. During July and August
of 1917, when the crew was new to the game and
the tendency to run wild was perhaps strongest, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
all the offenses for which the commander held
mast and which were passed upon by deck court-martials
comprised overstaying liberty by a narrow
margin of minutes and other small infractions of the
strict disciplinary code of the Navy. And it should
be mentioned that the enlisted force was permitted
to be ashore no later than nine-thirty o’clock in the
evening. During the whole sojourn of the Corsair
in foreign waters, not a member of her company
was punished by a general court-martial. By way
of indicating how naval justice was dispensed, the

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> the first three months of war duty,
June, July, and August, the <em>Corsair</em> steamed
11,738 miles, which was the greatest distance logged
by any of the yachts during the same period. There
was little time or opportunity for the grooming
and tinkering which a pleasure craft is presumed to
receive. Blow high, blow low, she went to sea at
the appointed hour and the fires were never dead
under the boilers. In her forward deck-house was a
couplet, carved on a panel of wood, which she was
living up to in full measure:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<em>North, East, South and West,</em></div>
    <div class="verse indent1"><em>The Corsair sails and knows no rest.</em>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first cruise of August took the yacht to Saint-Nazaire,
on the 4th, in company with the <em>Aphrodite</em>,
<em>Kanawha</em>, and <em>Noma</em>, to escort a group of empty
transports to sea. This was safely accomplished,
and the <em>Corsair</em> returned to Brest where the <em>Celtic</em>
was waiting to be guarded through the danger zone.
For lack of destroyers it was the business of the
yachts to take the big ships out after they had discharged
their troops or supplies. Having parted
company with the <em>Celtic</em> at Fourteen West and
wished her good luck, the <em>Corsair</em> hastened back
for coal and further orders, which were to cruise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
in the regular patrol area. The American steamer
<em>Carolyn</em> was expected, inbound and running alone,
and the <em>Corsair</em> searched a waste of waters until
the magic of the radio found the unseen ship and
whispered to her this comforting message:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am thirty miles west of you. Pass north of Belle
Isle and I will intercept you at daylight, in time to
escort you into Quiberon Bay.</p>
</div>

<p>The skipper of the <em>Carolyn</em> had become a trifle
confused in his bearings and was glad to be led to
a safe anchorage where he could join a coastwise
convoy for Bordeaux and so reach his destination.</p>

<p>To the <em>Corsair</em> then fell the experience of protecting
a cargo steamer whose speed was so slow that
she crept through the dangerous stretch of sea like a
rheumatic snail and was a tempting target for any
prowling submarine. It was all in the day’s work,
although a bit trying to the nerves, and Commander
Kittinger’s report indicates the nature of the task:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was assigned to escort duty with the
American steamer <em>Manto</em> bound from Saint-Nazaire,
France, to America. A conference was held with the
captain of the <em>Manto</em> at Saint-Nazaire on the evening
of August 22nd, the day before sailing. The <em>Manto</em> is
a small, low-powered steamer under charter by the
Navy Department. The captain stated that he could
make between eight and nine knots in favorable
weather, but with a head sea and a stiff breeze he
could not make more than six knots.</p>

<p>At 10.12 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, August 22nd, the <em>Manto</em> was ready
and got under way with <em>Corsair</em> escorting. The route<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
was laid through Chenal du Nord and into Quiberon
Bay at Croisic. During this time the <em>Manto</em> was able
to make about six knots on the course, not zigzagging
in these waters. After entering Quiberon Bay she was
able to make eight knots. The wind continued in force
from the west and at 3.55 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the convoy and escort
anchored at Quiberon Peninsula to await more favorable
weather.</p>

<p>The wind continued in force and direction during
the night, but to avoid further delay a start was made
at 5.23 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, August 24th. After clearing Teignouse
Passage, took up Base Course 275°. Convoy was unable
to make more than five knots good into the rough
head sea and strong breeze from west. Escort steamed
at ten knots and zigzagged at 45° and 60° on each side
of Base Course in order to keep position. This continued
throughout the morning and at noon Penmarch
Point was still in sight.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the force of the wind diminished
and the convoy made better headway. By noon,
August 24th, the wind became a light breeze and the
convoy was making about eight knots good on the
Base Course. After noon the barometer fell decidedly,
decreasing a half inch in eight hours, and with it the
wind increased to a strong breeze with an overcast sky
and driving rain squalls which reduced the visibility
to practically nil. The convoy dropped back to about
five knots.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Up to the time of darkness the convoy and escort
were making so little progress that a hostile submarine
would have been able to manœuvre and attain any
position desired for attack. After darkness the lack of
visibility was the best protection that could be had. I
believe that the best scheme for getting a low speed
vessel of the <em>Manto</em> type through the danger zone from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>Saint-Nazaire would be to have her proceed from
thence to the Brest rendezvous with the convoy using
the protected inshore waters. After arrival at Brest
she should await favorable weather so that she could
be escorted through the danger zone at her best speed.</p>
</div>

<p>By way of variety, the <em>Corsair</em> was next ordered
to the English Channel to pick out the American
supply ship <em>Erny</em> from a convoy escorted by H.M.S.
<em>Devonshire</em> and carry her into Saint-Nazaire. This
was the first taste of the Channel Patrol, of cruising
in those black and crowded waters where the numerous
routes of traffic crossed and converged, and
ships ran blind with no lights showing, and the risk
of collision was much greater than the chance of
submarine attack. The yachts regularly assigned
to this coastwise escort duty saw more of it than
the <em>Corsair</em>, but she learned to know the meaning
of that lusty chantey of the war zone, “On the
Channel Run”:</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> laid a course for the secret meeting-place
where she hoped to make contact with the
convoy and picked up the Lizard Light, cruising in
rough water for a day and a night until the flotilla
of merchant ships was sighted, when she signalled
the <em>Erny</em> to follow and so returned to France. This
errand brought the month of August to a close. It
would have seemed incredible to the crew, before
they sailed from home, that they could spend a
summer in the war zone and steam more than eleven
thousand miles without seeing a submarine or enjoying
the excitement of a torpedo attack. They
had passed large quantities of floating wreckage,
tragic evidence that the enemy was active, and the
S.O.S. calls of frightened ships had often come to
the radio-room, but this was all. One inference was
that the yachts had been of real service and that
the U-boats were learning to be wary of them and
their rapid-fire batteries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The autumn was to be much more eventful. On
September 5th the <em>Corsair</em> stood out from Brest to
look for an American supply convoy which included
the valuable steamers <em>Edward Luckenbach</em>, <em>Dakotan</em>,
<em>Montanan</em>, and <em>El Occidente</em>. While steering for the
latitude and longitude named in the confidential
orders, a small boat under oars and sail was descried
from the bridge. A few minutes later a second boat
was sighted, and the <em>Corsair</em> bore down to save the
castaways who were frantically appealing for help.
They were in two dories, eleven men in all, who
were hauled aboard and made comfortable by the
crew of the yacht. They were from the French
fishing vessel <em>Sadi Carnot</em> which had been shelled
by a submarine while homeward bound from the
Grand Banks to Saint-Malo with a cargo of salted
cod.</p>

<p>Impassioned, with many gestures, these weather-beaten
Breton sailors cursed the Germans who had
placed bombs under the hatches of their beloved
bark. The <em>Corsair’s</em> men listened eagerly while they
cheered their weary guests with sandwiches and
coffee. Presently a hail from the bridge announced
that another boat was adrift to the westward, and
the mariners of the <em>Sadi Carnot</em> yelled vociferous
joy. Five more comrades of theirs were deftly
picked up, leaving three boats still unaccounted for,
and the <em>Corsair</em> searched for them in vain.</p>

<p>Another boat was discovered a little later, it is
true, but the men in it made no sign—four of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
them, all corpses which washed about in the water
under the thwarts or were grotesquely doubled up
like bundles of old clothes. They were English seamen
and the boat bore the name of the British
steamer <em>Malda</em>. As one of the <em>Corsair’s</em> signal-men
wrote in his diary; “It was a ghastly sight. The
French fishermen we have on board were almost
starved and frozen. They could not have lived
more than another day or so. Imagine their feelings
when they saw the <em>Malda’s</em> boat with the dead men
and knew that this would soon have been their own
fate.”</p>

<p>It was later reported in Brest that another ship
had picked up the <em>Malda’s</em> boat in passing and had
discovered that the bodies of the English sailors
were riddled with bullets from a machine gun, presumably
after they had abandoned their steamer.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> kept on her way and had no trouble
in finding her convoy of four vessels with which she
started for Saint-Nazaire at thirteen knots. Off
Belle Isle, the <em>Montanan</em> developed a fit of hysterics
and opened fire on an imaginary flock of submarines
which turned out to be blackfish in a sportive mood.
The other merchant steamers promptly joined in
the bombardment and banged away for all they
were worth, at the same time stampeding most
zealously. They scattered over the sea like hunted
ducks and the indignant <em>Corsair</em> endeavored to recall
and soothe them.</p>

<p>“We could see what they were shooting at,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
noted a quartermaster on the yacht, “but believed
it to be the splash of a big fish. However, they were
thoroughly convinced that Fritz was out to pull
some of his morning hate stuff. The ships of the
convoy were so excited that they shot all over the
ocean. One of their shells missed us by a hundred
yards or so and we got sore. I sent them a signal,
‘<em>Cease firing at once and come within hail</em>.’ They
paid no attention, but we rounded up the bunch and
escorted them safely into port and then beat it out
to sea again.... We passed close to a submarine
last night, but could not find him. We got the smell
of his Diesel engines and I guess he was charging
his batteries and ducked under when he heard us.”</p>

<p>The emotions of this startled convoy were not
easily calmed, for the commander of the <em>Corsair</em> records,
an hour after the alarm, “Proceeding again
in close formation. The <em>Edward Luckenbach</em> fired
one shot at a flock of gulls on the water.” Concerning
the general bombardment he officially observes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <em>Montanan</em> opened fire at a disturbance made by
a large fish, abeam and to port, distance about one
mile. The fish was clearly seen and observed from this
ship when it jumped from the water twice and then
swam away near the surface. A few minutes later a
school of porpoises appeared and all the transports
opened fire. The firing was widely dispersed and apparently
not aimed at any visible object. The shells from
the <em>Montanan</em> landed abreast of the <em>Corsair</em>. None of
them burst. The <em>Oise</em>, a French vessel of the escort,
attempted to investigate the splash made by the fish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
but had to draw away when fire was opened at the
porpoises.</p>
</div>

<p>These false alarms happened often, and during
her next tour at sea the <em>Corsair</em> sounded the call to
battle stations on two different occasions, reported
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) Sighted an object which was believed to be a
submarine about four miles ahead. Two submarine
warnings were received, one before and one after sighting
object. Upon arriving at point where object had
been sighted, no evidence could be detected of the
presence of a submarine.</p>

<p>(2) Sighted object on starboard beam, distance 3000
yards, which appeared to be a periscope. Informed
convoy and headed for object. No. 1 gun crew opened
fire when object became visible in gun-sight telescopes,
followed by fire from convoy. When we approached
close to object it proved to be a black spar, riding about
vertical, six feet out of water. The heavy swell running
caused the spar to disappear at intervals, which gave
it the semblance of a submarine operating.</p>

<br>

<p>Until the merchant convoys became more accustomed
to the routine of their hazardous employment,
they were a source of almost continual anxiety
to the yachts and other naval craft escorting
them, and the work was more harassing than may
appear on the surface. As a sample one may select
from the <em>Corsair’s</em> daily experiences such an incident
as the following, under date of September 5th:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Signalled French gunboat <em>Oise</em> to take position on
port bow of leading transport. <em>Corsair</em> took position on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>starboard bow. The <em>El Occidente</em> was rapidly gaining
position. Proceeded about five miles and <em>El Occidente</em>
turned out of formation and slowed down. I then
ordered <em>Montanan</em> to reduce speed until convoy had
caught up and then proceeded with the <em>Corsair</em> to
<em>El Occidente</em>. Found out that this steamer had sighted
the ship’s boat of the S.S. <em>Malda</em> with four dead men
in it and had stopped to investigate. I ordered her to
rejoin immediately and cause no further delay, and
also to stop using her signal searchlight as evening
twilight had come on. On rejoining, found that the
transports had gotten in line abreast and were all
communicating with each other by signal searchlights.
By this time it was growing dark and it became necessary
to order them by radio to cease signalling with
lights. They paid no attention to signals to form column
and continued the formation of line abreast covering
about four miles front. About 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the moon
rose so that all ships were visible. Went close to each
and ordered them to form column. By 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> succeeded
in getting them in column formation.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair’s</em> crew had been hoping to visit England
and the opportunity came, but not precisely
as they might have wished it. The yacht was ordered
to proceed to Devonport on September 13th to load
a cargo of depth charges for the other naval vessels
on the French coast. It was something like asking
a man to make a railway journey from New York
to Boston with a stick of dynamite in every pocket
of his clothes. With luck it might be done, but he
would feel painfully eager to avoid any more bumping
or jostling than could be helped. And as has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
been said, the Channel was an extraordinarily
crowded and darkened thoroughfare. This was getting
on with the war, however, and the unterrified
<em>Corsair</em> duly anchored in Plymouth Harbor. Instructed
by Admiralty officers, she shifted to moorings
at a jetty of the British naval docks where a
lighter came alongside, and the <em>Corsair</em> bluejackets,
with gingerly care, hoisted in almost a hundred
“ash cans.” This quick-tempered merchandise included
such items as these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">34 Depth Charges, Type D.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">14 Boxes Gun Cotton, Dry.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">68 Boxes First Fittings.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of this trip to England, one of the petty officers
wrote in his little notebook:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Caught my first glimpse of John Bull’s country early
this morning when we arrived at Plymouth, a very
beautiful spot. A British army camp is on the hill and
we are soon to have a base here. It sounds good to hear
the English language again. Rated liberty and had a
splendid time. I guess we will make some knots on our
way back to Brest, as we have enough TNT on board
to blow up the whole fleet. If a submarine hits us this
time—good-night! I hope the luck of the Navy will
take care of the old ship this cruise.</p>

<p><em>September 15th.</em> Got back to Brest at 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Our
radio picked up two German submarines near us which
were talking with Zeebrugge. They were probably
looking for us and our cargo of mines, but we gave
them the slip. When we hauled out of Plymouth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
British jackies on their warships gave us cheer after
cheer—yells of “Hello, Hello, Yanks,” “Hurrah for
the <em>Corsair</em>,” and “Three cheers for Uncle Sam.” They
handed us more cheers when we sailed and we gave
them as good as they sent. Plenty of excitement last
night. I noticed a rowboat with two men in it hovering
around the ship. I hailed them, but got no answer.
They left, but the same boat approached the gangway
an hour later. I threatened to shoot them and they
turned around and vamoosed. I can’t imagine who or
what they were, but it was peculiar that they should
pick this night to hang about, when we had all those
mines aboard.</p>

<p><em>September 16th.</em> I had a long talk with a couple of
British sailors off the <em>Goshawk</em>. One of them had been
in the Jutland battle. He tells me the Germans have
invented an artificial fog to hide behind, something
like our smoke screen, but better. The English are
experimenting with it. They got the fog all right, but
it nearly asphyxiated every man in the ship.... I
don’t know what has happened to all our officers. They
are so blamed disagreeable that there is no pleasing
them. They canned Copeland off the bridge and put
me back on signal watches. I wanted to know why I
had been rated a quartermaster. They said it was so I
could draw the extra pay. I darn near threw it in their
faces. If I can’t hold the job I don’t want the rate.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was again assigned to the convoys
and the same chronicler has this to say of the remaining
days of September:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>21st.</em> Saw a very wonderful sight. Two submarines
were reported off Belle Isle, so we had an extra escort
of four seaplanes, four little fighting aeroplanes, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
seventy-five-foot chaser, and a big French dirigible.
They went out to help us carry some empties beyond
the war zone, the same ships we had taken in, <em>Montanan</em>,
<em>Dakotan</em>, <em>Luckenbach</em>, and <em>El Occidente</em>. The air
craft flew over us fifty miles offshore. The dirigible
made the signal, “<em>Submarine below</em>” but he was so
far off that he had submerged when we got there.
Another dirigible came out from Brest and looked us
over, but soon went back. This evening we passed the
body of a dead sailor, but did not pick it up; also an
empty dory. <em>Aphrodite</em> and <em>Alcedo</em> are with us.</p>
</div>

<p>The American Army had begun to move overseas
in a swelling tide of khaki and the transports
came faster and faster. No sooner had the <em>Corsair</em>
seen the last of one group than another was waiting.
On September 28th she left port to seek contact
with the store-ships <em>City of Atlanta</em>, <em>Willehad</em>,
<em>Artemus</em>, and <em>Florence Luckenbach</em>, and a British
destroyer which was the senior vessel of the escort.
Having found them, the subsequent proceedings
were such as sprinkled gray hairs on the heads of
the commander and the officers of the <em>Corsair</em>. The
War Diary records it in this summary fashion:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>September 29th.</em> <em>Noma</em> signalled by blinker tube that
<em>City of Atlanta</em>, the last ship of the convoy, was having
engine trouble and could not keep position. Signalled
to <em>Noma</em> to stand by her. <em>Noma</em> and <em>City of Atlanta</em>
dropped astern and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>3.32 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Received radio from <em>Alcedo</em>, “<em>I have been
rammed by convoy. Stand by.</em>” Headed back to look for
<em>Alcedo</em> and found the <em>Willehad</em> out of position and making
the best of her way to rejoin. Communicated with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>the <em>Willehad</em> by megaphone and was informed that she
had fouled the <em>Alcedo</em> but that the yacht had rejoined
and was in position with the escort. During this détour,
received from the <em>Noma</em>, “<em>I am proceeding with the
City of Atlanta.</em>” At this time a large convoy was observed
standing to the northward and cutting off the
<em>Noma</em> and <em>City of Atlanta</em> from our convoy.</p>

of Atlanta</em> and was proceeding to <em>Teignouse Channel</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>So much for the routine of faithful endeavor,
continual danger, and incessant vigilance! The
month of October was very different. It was memorable
in the <em>Corsair’s</em> calendar because she fought a
submarine, rescued many survivors of abandoned
ships, and saw two fine transports torpedoed, the
<em>Antilles</em> and the <em>Finland</em>, with heavy loss of life.
There was no more grumbling at the uneventful
drudgery of war. The crowded activity began on
the second day of October when this radio message
was caught and decoded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To all Allied men-of-war,—from Land’s End:</p>

<p>Picked up five men of French fishing vessel sunk by
submarine.</p>

<p>Five boats still adrift—twenty-one men. Position
39-JSD.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was in company with the yachts
<em>Wakiva</em> and <em>Alcedo</em>, and promptly signalled them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
disregard her movements as she was going in search
of survivors. Shortly after noon, the wreck of a
schooner was sighted, the hull awash, and many
barrels of oil floating near it. The <em>Corsair’s</em> gunners
fired seven shots into the derelict, but were unable
to sink it and the yacht hastened on her errand of
mercy, guided by the squared areas of the secret
chart to which the radio message had referred.
Three hours later the first boat was found, a dory
four men from the French fishing bark, <em>Saint
Pierre</em>, which had been set on fire by a boarding
party from a U-boat one hundred and eighty miles
off Ushant.</p>

<p>The mate, who was one of those rescued, swore
that after the crew of the <em>Saint Pierre</em> had scrambled
into the boats two more large submarines appeared,
and that all three of these infernal sea monsters
had made a circuit of the hapless bark before
destroying her. It was also his belief that each submarine
was very formidable, at least a hundred
metres in length and mounting two large cannon.</p>

<p>The crew of the <em>Corsair</em> cheered at the tidings
while they sympathized with the forlorn fishermen.
“The U-boats were coming in bunches,” joyously
reflected the deck force, and the “black gang”
slung the coal with an earnest determination to
give her twenty knots or blow the boilers out of her.
The ship raced to scan the sea for the other boats
of the <em>Saint Pierre</em> and at 4.35 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> heard firing in
the direction of a tall barkentine whose sails gleamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
seven miles to the northward. Here was a second
fisherman in trouble and a U-boat actually shelling
her within sight of the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em>! Ten minutes
more, with speed worked up to eighteen knots, and
the submarine could be clearly recognized through
the binoculars aimed from bridge and crow’s-nest.</p>

<p>Etched very small against the horizon was the
deck, like a fine, black line, and the conning tower
as a tiny hump in the middle, while a gun winked
as a red spark, and the water splashed high near
the target of a sailing vessel and was visible as so
many white specks resembling dabs of cotton. The
<em>Corsair</em> was then four miles distant, too far to use
her own guns effectively. The submarine delayed
five minutes longer, rolling on the surface and using
her battery in order to sink the fisherman without
wasting a precious torpedo on a victim so unimportant.
Then the cruel U-boat filled her ballast
tanks and submerged as a whale sounds when
alarmed. Sighs from the <em>Corsair’s</em> decks were mingled
with the deep and hearty curses of the saltwater
vocabulary. The commander expurgated his
report when it came to writing it, and this was his
unadorned narrative:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Shortly after this, six dories were observed pulling
away from the vessel. At 5.08 we came up and found
her to be the French barkentine, <em>Eugene Louise</em>, from
the Grand Banks to Saint-Malo. Searched for whereabouts
of the enemy. A long wake was observed. Ran
the ship into this wake and at 5.16, at the place where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
it disappeared, let go an English depth charge, 120
pounds TNT. Circled around and passed close to survivors’
boats and asked them the location of the enemy.
They were so badly demoralized that they could give
no intelligible replies and pointed generally to the westward.
Search was continued and at 5.34 returned and
picked up the survivors, the entire crew of the <em>Eugene
Louise</em>.</p>

<p>At 5.45 we started ahead at eighteen knots. The first
estimate made of the damage to the <em>Eugene Louise</em>
was that her bob-stays had been carried away and that
her topmasts and topgallant-masts would probably
come down. At this time she was hove to with all
square sails aback. The fore-staysails and jib halliards
having been let go, the sails were halfway down the
stays. Approaching closer to make a careful inspection,
we found that what appeared to be the bob-stays
were a couple of rope-ends hanging from the dolphin
striker to the water.</p>

<p>Attempts were made to persuade the crew to return
to the <em>Eugene Louise</em> and bring her in. The captain
consented on condition that the <em>Corsair</em> should escort
him. He was assured that the <em>Corsair</em> would stand by.
After conferring with his crew he asked that one of the
ship’s officers would confirm this assurance in person.
The Gunnery Officer, Ensign Schanze, gave this assurance
to the crew in their own language. A long talk
ensued among the Frenchmen of the <em>Eugene Louise</em>.
The indications were that they had no intention of
boarding their ship again.</p>

<br>

<p>At 6.19 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> proceeded S. 17° East, speed fourteen
knots, and continued search for survivors of the <em>Saint
Pierre</em>. Opened communication with some British
destroyers and informed them of the condition and
position of the <em>Eugene Louise</em>. At 9.08 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the destroyers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>radioed that they had the <em>Eugene Louise</em> in tow
and were proceeding to the Scillys. Heard two German
submarines communicating with each other by radio.
Five minutes later heard two more enemy submarines
in radio communication. The signals were coming in
very strongly which indicated their close proximity.
Under these circumstances it was considered unwise
to take the <em>Eugene Louise</em> in tow without the presence
of escorting vessels.</p>
</div>

<p>It was an animated scene aboard the <em>Corsair</em>
when the thirty-one men and officers of the <em>Eugene
Louise</em> were disputing whether or not they should
go back to their ship and sail her into port. There
were also two dogs, one of them shaggy and black,
who barked in energetic approval of remaining on
the <em>Corsair</em>. Their Breton shipmates appeared to
share this opinion. Panic had gripped most of them.
They were literally frightened out of their wits.
Red kerchiefs knotted about their heads, gold rings
twinkling in their ears, they looked like shipwrecked
buccaneers, but their spirit was quite otherwise.</p>

<p>The captain of the <em>Eugene Louise</em> was a man of
stout heart and, besides, he owned a share of the
barkentine. He raced between bridge and deck,
conferring, imploring, expostulating, but his fishermen
refused to follow him. They were fed up with
submarine warfare and, in their opinion, once was
enough. The next U-boat would undoubtedly cut
their throats and it was a long road to Saint-Malo.
Their refusal brought genuine grief to the navigating
officer of the <em>Corsair</em>. Nothing would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
pleased Lieutenant Robert E. Tod more than to
sail the barkentine <em>Eugene Louise</em> into the nearest
French port, and he had already volunteered for the
job.</p>

<p>He was a faithful and zealous officer of the <em>Corsair</em>,
but, after all, she was a steam kettle and his
heart went out to the spars and stays and canvas
of a sailing vessel and the winds that served to
steer her by. Such had been his own training as a
yachtsman, and he knew he could shove this French
square-rigger along for all she was worth, with
thirty nimble Breton sailors to swarm aloft. Alas,
Captain Pierre Catharine, of the <em>Eugene Louise</em>,
could not argue his frightened crew into accepting
this sporting proposition. It was left for the industrious
British destroyers to take her to safety at
the end of a tow-line. The news was gratifying,
when received later, that the barkentine with her
cargo of fish, so welcome to the Breton villages,
had been rescued from the brutal destruction of the
enemy. One of the <em>Corsair’s</em> deck force sadly noted
in his journal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I also volunteered to go with Commodore Tod as
quartermaster for signals, but our skipper decided to
leave her derelict. It was a great disappointment.
Mr. Tod thanked me for offering to take a chance on
the barkentine, which I appreciated.</p>
</div>

<p>During the night of this same day the <em>Corsair</em>
was zigzagging toward Brest at twelve knots when
she encountered one of the submarines which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
been running amuck among the fishing vessels.
The weather was hazy and obscured and an occasional
rain squall drove across the ship. The bridge
and deck watches were peering into the gloom
which lifted between the squalls to let a watery
moon gleam through. Lieutenant Tod was officer
of the watch and Quartermaster Augustus C.
Smith, Jr., stood at the wheel. At 11.25 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> one of
the whistling flurries of rain and wind had passed
and the sea was visible in the illumination of the
misty moonlight.</p>

<p>No more than five hundred yards away the outline
of a large submarine was clearly discernible as
it rested at leisure upon the surface of the water,
having emerged, no doubt, to open hatches and
give the crew a breathing spell. This was a sight
which the crew of the <em>Corsair</em> had dreamed of. It
was too good to be true. Quartermaster Augustus
Smith, a bland, unruffled young man in all circumstances,
had an uncommonly keen pair of eyes and
he did not have to be informed that yonder was the
enemy. He spun the wheel at the order. Lieutenant
Tod threw the handle of the engine-room indicator
to emergency speed, and the <em>Corsair</em> swung to rush
straight at the U-boat, hoping to ram.</p>

<p>Commander Kittinger and his executive, Lieutenant
Commander Porter, instantaneously appeared
upon the bridge, while Ensign Gray dashed
for the chart-house deck to make certain that the
forward gun crew had sighted the submarine for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
themselves. There was excitement, but no confusion.
Long training and disciplined habit had prepared
them all for such an episode as this, like
sprinters set and ready on the mark. No time was
lost in wondering what ought to be done. Those
who hunted Fritz had to be quickwitted or else he
would scupper them.</p>

<p>The submarine, caught napping, went ahead on
its oil engines, moving slowly on the surface and
almost in the same direction as the plunging <em>Corsair</em>
whose forward battery endeavored to bear on the
mark, which was difficult for lack of a bow-chaser.
Number Two gun barked once and the shell kicked
up foam astern of the U-boat which was submerging
in the very devil of a hurry, as one may imagine.
Before the <em>Corsair</em> could fire again, the conning
tower had vanished and the gray shape of the slinking
submarine was slanting downward in a “crash
dive.”</p>

<p>The yacht had three hundred yards to go before
she passed over the spot. Her keel failed to strike
and rip through the thin plates of the German craft
which was, perhaps, thirty feet beneath the sea,
but a bubbling wake was visible and into it the
depth charges began to drop from the stern of the
<em>Corsair</em>. The gunner’s mates played no favorites,
but let go an English “ash can” with 120 pounds
of TNT, then two French “Grenades Giraud,” and
finally an American Sperry bomb.</p>

<p>All four of the Allied gifts for Fritz functioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
with terrific effect. The <em>Corsair</em>, charging ahead at
full speed to avoid being hoisted herself, was shaken
as though she had hit a reef. The sea was violently
agitated in a foaming upheaval. The men asleep
below decks came spilling up through the hatches,
convinced that the ship had been blown up. One of
the French fishermen vowed that he had a glimpse
of the shadowy shape of the submarine as it passed
directly under the <em>Corsair</em>. It seemed reasonable to
assume that the four depth charges had been placed
where they would do the most good. Nothing could
survive the destructive effect of the solid wall of
water impelled by these explosions. And the submarine
had been near enough, in all probability, to
receive the force of these rending shocks.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> moved ahead for five minutes, along
the track which the U-boat had taken when it submerged.
There was the hope that it might rise to
the surface disabled, but the moonlit surface of the
sea was unbroken. The mist had cleared and the
sky was bright. Swinging about, the <em>Corsair</em> retraced
her path on the chance of finding some sign
or token of a shattered U-boat. Soon she ran through
a spreading oil slick, a patch of greasy calm amid
the glinting waves, and the smell of mineral oil was
strong. They sniffed it greedily aboard the <em>Corsair</em>
and the French fishermen forgot to mourn the
<em>Eugene Louise</em>. It was their belief that the glorious
American Navy had evened the score with the
Boche. The bluejackets were of the same opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
and felt confident that the <em>Corsair</em> would be
awarded a star to display on her funnel, the <em>Croix
de Guerre</em> of the sea, to show that she had bagged
her submarine.</p>

<p>The officers were not quite so cock-sure. Daylight
might have disclosed some bits of <em>débris</em>, enough
wreckage to substantiate the claim beyond a
shadow of doubt, but the mere presence of floating
oil was no longer admitted as final proof either by
the American Navy Department or the British
Admiralty. Submarines were apt to leak a certain
amount of fuel oil, or to blow it through the exhaust
when running on the surface, and it was suspected
that Fritz had learned the trick of opening a valve
in order to delude the pursuers into the belief that
they had crippled or smashed him.</p>

<p>In this instance, however, the circumstantial evidence
was very strongly in favor of the <em>Corsair</em>,
even though officials ashore might decline to give
her documentary credit. The submarine had been
unusually close aboard, almost under the ship,
when four depth charges were let go and all exploded
perfectly. Commander Kittinger was so reluctant
to claim too much that he presented no
more than the terse facts and let the matter rest
with that. Earlier in the war, destroyers had been
granted the star on a funnel for evidence no more
conclusive than this—depth charges dropped
within a fatal radius and the presence of abundant
fuel oil as the aftermath.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>It is highly probable that the <em>Corsair</em> wiped one
U-boat from the active list on this moonlit night in
the Bay of Biscay and her crew had the right to
feel pride in the exploit. That careful, well-poised
petty officer, Quartermaster Augustus Smith, who
saw the whole show from his station at the wheel,
took pains to write down his own observations
which confirmed, in every respect, the conclusions
of Commander Kittinger and his officers:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the night of October 2, 1917, at 11.25 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, a
dark object was sighted by the officer of the deck,
bearing about three points on the port bow. The officer
of the deck, after looking at the object with the night
glasses, called out that it was a submarine. The order
was given for full left rudder and to steady on the submarine
which was then plainly visible in the moonlight.
At the same time emergency speed was rung up and
before we had swung to the new course we were fast
gaining speed. The captain almost immediately came
on the bridge and ordered that a shot be taken at the
submarine which was about three hundred yards away
and moving slowly on the surface in the general direction
we were steering. We swung a little to starboard
and one shot was fired which cleared the periscope and
showed the submarine distinctly for a second.</p>

<p>From the way the <em>Corsair</em> answered the rudder we
were making fine speed. The submarine completely
disappeared when we were just a little way off. As we
crossed her apparent course we began dropping depth
charges, four in all. As we passed over her position we
went full right rudder, dropping two of the cans as we
swung. We then steadied on North 74° East, the original
course, and ran it about five minutes. We then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
slowed to thirteen knots and went full right rudder,
and steadied on South 80° West. Returning over the
spot where the charges had exploded, we ran into a
great slick of oil that seemed to spread out for several
hundred yards. A strong odor of oil could be smelled,
even on the bridge.</p>

<span class="fs80">WHEN THE ANTILLES WENT DOWN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">For</span> more than three months the <em>Corsair</em> had
been escorting transports and supply steamers
to and fro, in an area of ocean where the hostile
submarines cruised incessantly. Not a ship in all
these unwieldy convoys had been torpedoed, and
the few hard-driven yachts could feel, without
boasting, that they were doing their bit to keep the
road open to France. It was unreasonable to expect,
however, that the record could be kept wholly clear
of disaster. The fortune of war was not as kind as
this.</p>

<p>The unhappy event occurred without warning
on October 17th when the transport <em>Antilles</em>, a fine,
seven-thousand-ton steamer of the Southern Pacific
Company, was sent to the bottom with many of her
people. It was no fault of the escort, for there was
never a sight of a periscope nor any other indication
that a submarine was near. The <em>Corsair</em> did what
she could and did it well, saving survivors from the
sea with the readiness and courage that might have
been expected.</p>

<p>The convoy had sailed from Saint-Nazaire two
days earlier, waiting at Quiberon for one of the ships
to join. With the <em>Antilles</em> were the <em>Henderson</em> and
the <em>Willehad</em>. The escort comprised the <em>Corsair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
phrodite</em>, and the <em>Kanawha</em>, which replaced the
<em>Wakiva</em> after this smaller yacht had returned to
port because of leaky rivets in the main boiler.
With the circumstances as they were, no better
protection could have been given this small convoy
of three transports. The Queenstown destroyers
were employed in guarding the laden ships inward
bound, meeting them far offshore, but the American
Patrol Force in France had to take them to sea
again as best it could, with the yachts and whatever
aid the French Navy was able to offer.</p>

<p>The small flotilla of coal-burning destroyers
which was sent to base on Brest had not yet arrived
and was <em>en route</em> from the Azores. Captain W. B.
Fletcher, who commanded the Patrol Force at this
time, and who was superseded by Admiral Wilson
a little later, received a certain amount of adverse
criticism because of the loss of the <em>Antilles</em>, but the
fact is evident that he had taken all the precautions
within his power to send this convoy safely through
the danger zone.</p>

<br>

<p>The three transports and the three large yachts
proceeded without incident until the morning of
the second day at sea, when a freshening wind
kicked up a boisterous sea and the <em>Kanawha</em> found
herself in trouble. She was taking the water green
over her bows and the decks were flooded. To avoid
being seriously battered, she was compelled to
reduce speed, and, to make matters worse, the
weather was growing rougher and a gale threatened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>Unable to maintain the standard speed of the convoy,
which slowed down, for a little while, to nine
knots in order to let the <em>Kanawha</em> attempt to regain
position, her captain signalled for permission to
part company and return to port. This was granted,
as the heavy weather had made her of no service
to the convoy. Thereafter the formation was maintained
in this wise:</p>

<p>The third day out, October 17th, dawned clear
with a moderate wind from the southwest and a
disturbed sea covered with whitecaps. The ships
were zigzagging, with all lookouts properly kept and
gunners at their stations. The <em>Antilles</em> had her own
battery which was manned by a detachment of the
Naval Armed Guard. Early in the morning, at 6.45,
she was steaming directly astern of the <em>Corsair</em> during
one of the frequent changes of course. The light
was still poor, and it was this hour, before the sunrise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
had brightened the sea, which the submarines
had found most favorable for attack.</p>

<p>The <em>Antilles</em> was seen to sheer out to starboard
and the <em>Henderson</em> hoisted a signal which could not
be read from the bridge of the <em>Corsair</em>, but the
yacht swung about on the instant and sounded the
call to general quarters. There was no other indication
that the <em>Antilles</em> had been hit and mortally
wounded. Presently she was settling by the stern.
Then the bow rose in air, towered there, and the
ship plunged to the bottom five minutes after a
torpedo had ripped open her engine-room. Smoke
and dust and dirty whirlpools marked the spot
where she had been, and the sea was littered with
boats and bits of wreckage and struggling men. On
board the <em>Corsair</em> was Commander F. N. Freeman,
as commander of the patrol division to which the
<em>Corsair</em> and <em>Alcedo</em> were attached, and his report
contained the following description of the disaster:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>No explosion was heard on the <em>Corsair</em>, nothing was
seen of it, nor was a submarine sighted. The <em>Henderson</em>
immediately turned to starboard and made a smoke
screen, the <em>Willehad</em> turned to port and from knowledge
now at hand apparently passed very nearly over
the submarine that fired the torpedo. The <em>Alcedo</em>
turned back to the spot where the <em>Antilles</em> sank. The
<em>Corsair</em> steamed at nineteen knots directly astern of
the <em>Henderson</em> and to the northeast, followed by the
<em>Alcedo</em>. These two escorting vessels continued in the
vicinity of the wreckage until 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> No sign of
the submarine was seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>During all this time the <em>Alcedo</em> was picking up survivors
while the <em>Corsair</em> continued circling around the
boats and wreckage. The <em>Corsair</em> assisted in picking
up the survivors in outlying boats and patrolling the
vicinity until 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> All survivors having been
rescued, and it being impossible to overhaul either the
<em>Henderson</em> or the <em>Willehad</em> before nightfall, we set
course for Brest.</p>

<p>The total number of persons on board the <em>Antilles</em>
was 237. The number rescued by the <em>Corsair</em> was 50,
by the <em>Alcedo</em> 117—total rescued, 167.</p>

<p>It is believed that every man on the <em>Antilles</em> who
got into the water alive with life-belt on was rescued.
Attention is invited to the excellent work of the <em>Alcedo</em>
and <em>Corsair</em> in picking up survivors who were in the
boats, on wreckage and life-rafts, floating over an area
of several square miles. The <em>Corsair</em> picked up fifty
persons from outlying wreckage and lifeboats without
lowering a boat. The sea at this time was getting rough.</p>

<p>Officers from the <em>Antilles</em> have informed me that
there was a fire on board the ship during the early
morning, just before dawn, and that nearly all hands
had turned out. This may account for the comparatively
small loss of life, as the <em>Antilles</em> sank in seven
minutes or less. It is not known whether the lights
which had been turned on at the time of the fire were
visible from outboard, and whether this has anything
to do with the submarine attack. The <em>Corsair</em> reported
no lights on the <em>Antilles</em>. The statements of the survivors
are that several of them had seen the torpedo
just before it struck the ship. It is worthy of mention
that the conduct and bearing of the Armed Guard were
a credit to the service.</p>

<p>No visual signals of any kind were made by the
<em>Corsair</em> or <em>Alcedo</em> after nightfall at any time, and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
one PDL flash-light signal was noted in the convoy.
Only one radio signal was made and that at low power
to the <em>Henderson</em> in thick weather, at night. Commanding
officers were all thoroughly indoctrinated before
getting under way in regard to the course, zigzagging,
etc., and the escort vessels were unusually alert and
attentive.</p>
</div>

<p>The senior naval officer on board the <em>Antilles</em> was
Commander Daniel T. Ghent whose report to the
Navy Department contained many incidents of
interest in the story of the <em>Corsair</em>. Of the sixty-seven
men who perished with the ship, he stated
that forty-five of them belonged to the merchant
crew, four were members of the armed guard, sixteen
were soldiers who had been sent home, one was
an ambulance driver, and one a colored stevedore.
It was strange that the detonation of the torpedo
was unheard by the escort vessels and that there
was no visible disturbance, for on board the <em>Antilles</em>,
according to Commander Ghent, the explosion was
terrific. The ship shivered from stern to stem, listing
immediately to port. One of the lookouts in the
maintop, although protected by a canvas screen
about five feet high, was hurled clear of this screen
and killed when he struck the hatch below.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The explosion wrecked everything in the engine-room,
including the ice machine and dynamo, and
almost instantly flooded the compartment. The engine-room
was filled with ammonia fumes and with the high-pressure
gasses from the torpedo, and it is believed
that every one on duty there was either instantly killed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>or disabled, excepting one oiler. This man happened
to be on the upper gratings at the time. He tried to
escape through the engine-room door but found it
jammed and the knob blown off. Unable to force the
door and finding that he was being overcome by the
gases and ammonia fumes, he managed to escape
through the engine-room skylight just as the ship was
going under. Within a few seconds after the explosion,
the water was over the crossheads of the main engines
which were still turning over slowly. Of the twenty-one
men on duty in the engine and fire rooms, only three
escaped. Besides the oiler, two firemen crawled up
through a ventilator. The fact that the engines could
not be stopped and the headway checked, added to the
difficulty of abandoning ship.</p>

<p>That only four boats out of ten succeeded in getting
clear was due to this and several other causes,—the
short time the ship stayed afloat, which was four and
a half minutes by my watch, the rough sea, the heavy
list, and the destruction of boats by the explosion.
When there was no one left in sight on the decks, I
went aft on the saloon deck where several men were
struggling in the water near No. 5 boat and making no
attempt to swim away from the side of the ship. I
thought that they might be induced to get clear before
the suction carried them down. By this time, however,
the ship which was listed over at an angle of forty-five
degrees, started to upend and go down. This motion
threw me across the deck where I was washed overboard.</p>

<p>The behavior of the naval personnel was equal to
the best traditions of the service. The two forward
gun’s crews, in command of Lieutenant Tisdale, remained
at their gun stations while the ship went down
and made no effort to leave their stations until ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
to save themselves. Radio Electrician Ausburne went
down with the ship while at his station in the radio-room.
When the ship was struck, Ausburne and
McMahon were asleep in adjacent bunks opposite the
radio-room. Ausburne, realizing the seriousness of the
situation, told McMahon to get his life-preserver on,
saying, as he left to take his station at the radio key,
“Good-bye, Mac.” McMahon, later finding the radio-room
locked and seeing the ship was sinking, tried to
get Ausburne out, but failed.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Alcedo</em> returned to the scene of the
accident and circled about for two hours when the
<em>Alcedo</em> began the rescue of the survivors, the <em>Corsair</em>
continuing to look for the submarine. Too much credit
cannot be given to the officers and men of the <em>Corsair</em>
and <em>Alcedo</em> for their rescue work and for their whole-heartedness
and generosity in succoring the needs of
the survivors. The work of the medical officers attached
to these yachts was worthy of highest praise.</p>
</div>

<p>It is one of the many black marks against the
sinister record of the German submarine campaign
that the naval vessels with a convoy in such a
catastrophe as this were compelled to delay the
rescue of the survivors—dazed, wounded, helpless
men in the last struggle for life.</p>

<p>It was possible that the submarine might come
up to gloat over the murder it had wrought, or attempt
to take prisoners, or even to ram the lifeboats
or turn a machine gun on the struggling
wretches, as had happened more than once. Therefore,
in this instance the <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Alcedo</em> steamed
at full speed, dropping depth charges and manœuvring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
to avoid torpedo attack while they scouted to
drive away or destroy the ambushed U-boat.</p>

<p>As soon as it seemed advisable, they closed in
and undertook the work of saving life, the <em>Corsair</em>
still circling the outer edge of the area because of
her superior speed. One of her crew described the
scene in this manner:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It should be noted that although the <em>Corsair</em> spent
most of her time looking for the submarine, she picked
up a large number of survivors and without putting
over a boat. One of these rescues was that of a lad who
was riding upon an ammunition box. When the <em>Corsair</em>
was brought alongside him, he began to semaphore us
to keep off, and then he shouted to steer clear and go
easy because he had a cargo of shells and didn’t want
to blow up our ship. When we hoisted him aboard, he
begged us to fetch his salvaged ammunition along, as
he didn’t think it ought to be wasted. I doubt if he
had many shells in the box, but he surely did show the
right spirit, and the men agreed that he was “one
game little guy.”</p>

<p>Shortly before we picked up this fine young bantam,
we took aboard a loaded life-raft, under our starboard
side. It was a delicate piece of seamanship, with a
troublesome sea running, and the commander let
our executive, Captain Porter, show what he could do
with the yacht. The men of the <em>Antilles</em> owed a lot
to the skill with which the <em>Corsair</em> was handled that
morning.</p>

<p>One of the merchant crew of the <em>Antilles</em> had climbed
upon the upturned bow of a broken boat and was
seated astride the stern. Every wave was breaking over
his head and he clung to his precarious perch with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
arms and legs, like a jockey wrapped around the neck
of a runaway horse. How he managed to stick there
was a puzzle. He had drifted several hundred yards
clear of the rest of the wreckage but our executive
had an eye on him. “Skipper, I think we had better
circle around again,” said Captain Kittinger. The
“skipper” (Porter) replied that he would like to “go
get that fellow first,” pointing to the man on the
piece of boat. “Go ahead, skipper,” was the answer,
and before the yacht swung off to fetch another circle
we steered close to this lonely castaway and tossed him
the bight of a heaving-line. He grabbed it with a death
grip and we hauled him over the rail, but he was almost
unconscious from cold and exhaustion and we
had to pry his fingers open to make him let go the line.
The doctor scored an “assist” on this rescue.</p>
</div>

<p>These unfortunates had been flung into the sea
in a moment, some of them scrambling half-dressed
from their bunks. They became chilled to the bone,
half-strangled in the breaking waves, worn out
with trying to cling to overturned boats, submerged
live-rafts, doors and hatches and benches, the flotsam
spewed up by the stricken ship as she dived
under. Some of them swam from overloaded rafts
to find help elsewhere, or floundered without life-belts
until gallant comrades lent them a hand. It
was a dreadful business, new to the <em>Corsair</em> and
<em>Alcedo</em>; but all too familiar to the maritime annals
of the war.</p>

<p>It is not easy to quench a sailor’s sense of humor
even in the presence of death and disaster, and
Ensign Schanze wrote, in a letter to his mother:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The commander of a supply ship bound to New
York promised me that he would look Dad up if he
could possibly do so, and tell you how I was getting on.
His ship was in our party on the morning the <em>Antilles</em>
was torpedoed, and maybe he got sore at us for letting
a submarine scare the wits out of him. Our yacht had
to stop and fish a lot of very wet citizens out of the
ocean, and the last view I had of his ship was in a
great cloud of smoke, and he was crowding on full
speed to make his get-away. He was going like a scared
rabbit. He never even waved good-bye.</p>

<p>Another gentleman who promised to call on Dad
was a naval officer in charge of the gun crew of the
<em>Antilles</em>. I yanked him out of the ocean and helped
make him at home on the <em>Corsair</em> during the time
between the sinking of the ship and the return to
our base.</p>
</div>

<p>The fifty survivors saved by the <em>Corsair</em> found a
warm-hearted welcome. Nothing was too good for
them. They were promptly thawed out in the
cabins and engine-room and tucked into bunks,
while the crew, as a committee of the whole, ransacked
their bags and boxes for spare clothing.
They were ready and eager to give the shirts off
their backs, and some of them actually did so.
Every man who needed it was comfortably rigged
in the togs of Uncle Sam’s Navy and told to go
ashore with the clothes. You may be sure that such
treatment warmed the cockles of the hearts of these
forlorn derelicts from the <em>Antilles</em> and that they
cheered the <em>Corsair</em> before they left her.</p>

<p>The yacht’s officers made room in their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
quarters for the officers picked up from the <em>Antilles</em>.
These included Brigadier-General W. S. McNair,
of the United States Army; Lieutenant Commander
Ghent, Lieutenant J. D. Smith, and Lieutenant
R. D. Tisdale, of the Navy; Chief Officer A. G.
Clancy, Third Officer R. M. Christensen, Assistant
Engineer L. L. Rue, and Purser W. C. Gilbert.
They were most cordial in their expressions of
appreciation of the kindness and good-fellowship
which they had found in the yacht during the voyage
back to Brest.</p>

<p>A dramatic bit of gossip went the rounds of the
<em>Corsair</em> after she reached port. A steward of the
<em>Antilles</em> had been among those rescued and he was
heartily disliked aboard the yacht, the one exception
in the shipwrecked company. He was a Spaniard,
by name and complexion, and he displayed a
curiosity which the <em>Corsair’s</em> crew called “nosey.”
He was discovered poking about in all sorts of
places. Attempting to take a look at the radio-room,
he was tersely told to beat it or have his
block knocked off. The Executive Officer chased
him away from the after quarters, where he appeared
to be interested in the stateroom occupied
by General McNair. Thereafter the movements of
this gimlet-eyed passenger were vigilantly restricted.</p>

<p>The word came later from Saint-Nazaire that he
had been arrested by the French authorities and
shot as a notorious spy. The inference was that he
had been endeavoring to slip away to the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
States in the <em>Antilles</em> when fate returned him to the
secret intelligence service which had information
against him, and he was trapped by the heels. His
last words as he faced the firing squad, so the
<em>Corsair</em> story ran, were that the German submarines
would get the <em>Finland</em> on her next trip home, just
as they had intercepted and sunk the <em>Antilles</em>.
This was peculiarly interesting, because after coaling
ship and taking on stores, the <em>Corsair</em> was
ordered to escort a convoy which was expected to
sail from Saint-Nazaire on October 24th. The
transports were the <em>Buford</em>, <em>City of Savannah</em>, and
the <em>Finland</em>.</p>

<p>The flotilla of coal-burning destroyers had arrived
from the Azores to reinforce the yachts of the
Breton Patrol, and four of them were assigned to
this escort, the <em>Lamson</em>, <em>Flusser</em>, <em>Preston</em>, and <em>Smith</em>.
The yachts <em>Alcedo</em> and <em>Wakiva</em> were also detailed
to join the group, and no previous convoy outward
bound had been so heavily protected as this. The
loss of the <em>Antilles</em> had aroused excitement in the
United States because of the false report that the
attack had been made by a whole flock of submarines.
This was one of those hair-raising newspaper
yarns of war-time which would have been
important if true.</p>

<p>Steaming out to sea, the <em>Corsair</em> led the imposing
column, with a destroyer on each bow of the <em>Finland</em>,
the <em>Alcedo</em> to starboard of the <em>Buford</em>, the
<em>Wakiva</em> to port, and a destroyer hovering on each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
quarter of the <em>City of Savannah</em>. There had been no
intimation of danger other than the fanciful rumor
of the prediction made by the suddenly deceased
steward of the <em>Antilles</em> and the routine warning
included in the Force orders, “Enemy submarines
operating in war zone as usual.”</p>

<p>At 9.25 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, one day out from port, the <em>Finland</em>
was struck by a torpedo on the starboard side.
Again there was no sign of a submarine. This time,
however, the <em>Corsair</em> heard the explosion and saw
a huge column of water spout up against the ship.
But the <em>Finland</em> had no intention of sinking and
merely slowed down, then halted, blowing off steam
as though waiting for the other transports to catch
up with her. As seen from the <em>Corsair</em>, she rode on
an even keel and it was impossible to realize that a
torpedo had torn a hole thirty-five feet wide in her
side, into which the sea was gushing like a cataract.</p>

<p>On board the <em>Finland</em> were many of the survivors
of the <em>Antilles</em> and they were in no mood for an
encore. They set the pace for the crew of the <em>Finland</em>
in the race to abandon ship and the big transport
seemed fairly to spill boats and men from
every deck. They were dropping overboard before
she had wholly slackened way. It was an amazing
spectacle. At a distance the <em>Finland</em> made one think
of shaking apples from a tree.</p>
<br>

<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Several of us were standing by the engine-room
hatch [wrote Quartermaster Augustus Smith of the
<em>Corsair</em>], watching the <em>Finland</em> as she steamed along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>in that very slow convoy. We were discussing her
chances of getting through, and the story that the U-boats
were laying for her, when suddenly a white
burst of water rose under her bridge and climbed to
the top of the foremast. It seemed to be followed by
a pillar of dark smoke. At the same time the <em>Corsair</em>
was fairly lifted out of the sea by the force of the
explosion. All hands made a run for battle stations
without waiting for the call.</p>

<p>The first boat from the <em>Finland</em> was dangling from
the davits, half-filled with men, when somebody either
cut or let go the forward falls. The bow of this big
whaleboat crashed down to the water, dumping most
of them out. A few managed to hang on and were
struggling desperately when the after falls carried away
and the boat dropped upon the heads of the men already
in the sea. The next boat reached the water only
to be up-ended by the headway of the ship. Other
boats then waited for the ship to lose way and these
got clear all right, but we saw one or two more upset
and smashed.</p>

<p>When Commander Freeman, then on the <em>Corsair</em> as
division commander, realized that the <em>Finland</em> was not
sinking, he semaphored the message:</p>

<p>“Do you think you can make Saint-Nazaire?”</p>

<p>The answer came right back from the <em>Finland’s</em>
skipper:</p>

<p>“<em>Why not New York?</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> cracked on speed to search for the
submarine, instructing the <em>Wakiva</em> and <em>Alcedo</em> to
aid the <em>Finland’s</em> people who were adrift in boats or
upon rafts. Three destroyers proceeded on the voyage
with the two other transports while the fourth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
destroyer remained to operate with the <em>Corsair</em>.
Investigation had disclosed the fact that the <em>Finland</em>
was able to move under her own steam and the
task in hand was to put the crew back on board and
escort her into Brest for repairs. Meanwhile the
<em>Corsair</em>, in quest of the enemy, was letting a real
barrage of depth charges slide over her stern, and
her wake was one thundering geyser after another.
Eleven of these bombs jarred her rivets when they
went off, and if a man had any loose teeth in his
head he was liable to lose them entirely. Alas, no
<em>débris</em>, such as dead German sailors, rose to the
surface.</p>

<p>The report of the senior naval officer of the <em>Finland</em>,
Captain Stephen V. Graham, is a lucid narrative
and it is worth while to let him tell the tale:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Due to the congested condition at the port of debarkation,
which was often serious in the early days
of our transport service, the <em>Finland</em> had been unable
to accompany the group of fast troop transports to
which she belonged and which had proceeded on the
return voyage about two weeks earlier. On this occasion
she was in company with two freight transports
of the armed-guard category which were not able to
make more than eleven knots, but the three vessels
had an escort of four destroyers and three converted
yachts, which was uncommonly large at that time
when the demand exceeded the supply. It was frequently
necessary for the <em>Finland</em> to slow down to such
a speed as would enable an enemy submarine to take a
favorable position for attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>By daylight of October 28th the convoy had reached
a position near the line extending from the island of
Ushant to Cape Finisterre, which experience had shown
to be a particularly dangerous area. From that time
on, the senior naval officer of the <em>Finland</em> remained on
the bridge constantly and all the lookouts were exercising
the utmost vigilance.</p>

<p>The weather was cloudy and a moderate sea running,
and I was engaged in searching the water on both sides
with powerful binoculars. I had just finished gazing
at the starboard side when the naval signal quartermaster
on watch called out, “Commander! Torpedo!”
I turned and saw a torpedo about fifty or a hundred
yards distant making a surface run directly toward the
ship. The whirring of the torpedo’s propellers could be
heard when they broke the surface of the water. To
avoid it was impossible. The effect of the explosion
was considerable but not as great as had been anticipated.
No one on the bridge was injured.</p>

<p>I directed a radio operator to send out an S.O.S.
call but it was found that the aerial had been carried
away by the force of the explosion. The first report
that reached the bridge was that the forward fire-room
was flooded. At this time it did not appear probable
that the ship would sink but in a short time she
began to list to starboard and seemed to be settling.
I ordered the lowering of the remaining boats which
were hanging on their falls at the level of the promenade
deck. These boats were scarcely in the water
when the ship began to right herself, and the acting
master, Chief Officer John Jensen, who had gone below
to investigate the extent of the damage, returned to
the bridge and reported to me that the destruction
was confined to No. 4 hold, the bulkheads of which
were intact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>In the meantime I observed Third Assistant Engineer
George Mikkelson who had been on watch in the
engine-room when the torpedo struck the ship, moving
about the main deck with a wooden mallet in his hand
and endeavoring to drive the frightened firemen back
to their stations. He came to the bridge and reported
to me that the boilers and engines were not damaged
and that the ship could be got under way again in a
short time if the men could be induced to go to work.</p>

<p>The damaged compartment, just forward of the fire-rooms,
was used as a reserve coal bunker. At that time
it contained about six hundred tons of coal. After the
ship had been placed in dry-dock, upon her return to
France, it was found that most of this coal had run out
through the immense hole made in the side by the
explosion of the torpedo.</p>

<p>When I received the master’s report that the damage
was confined to this one compartment, I hailed
the boats which were close to the ship and directed
them to come alongside and also sent a signal to the
escorting yachts to turn back the <em>Finland’s</em> boats
which were approaching them and tell them to return
to the ship. These yachts, the <em>Alcedo</em> and <em>Wakiva</em>, had
come close to the <em>Finland</em> and lowered boats to rescue
people who had been cast into the water by the dropping
of two of the <em>Finland’s</em> boats.</p>

<p>The converted yacht <em>Corsair</em> and one of the destroyers
were circling at high speed around the <em>Finland</em> and
dropping depth charges in order to prevent the enemy
submarine from delivering a second attack on the
crippled <em>Finland</em>.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>While the <em>Finland’s</em> boats were in the water, a heavy
squall came up and rendered the return of the heavily
laden boats very difficult. They could come close only
on the starboard side and getting the people back on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>board was very slow work. Hoisting the boats was not
to be thought of, for every moment that this large ship
remained stopped was to risk grave danger of receiving
a second torpedo. As soon as the passengers were
aboard, the boats were cast adrift.</p>

<p>The ship got under way to return to the port of
Brest, 150 miles distant. She was escorted by the
<em>Corsair</em> and one of the destroyers, while another destroyer
remained with the <em>Alcedo</em> and <em>Wakiva</em> to afford
them protection until they had picked up the rest of
the <em>Finland’s</em> crew. During the return to port it became
necessary to send every one to the fire-room who could
shovel coal. Deck-hands, stewards, and even passengers,
including some of the discharged American ambulance
drivers, responded with alacrity to this call and
within a short time after starting ahead the ship was
making nearly fifteen knots, which was about as good
speed as she had made at any time during her employment
in the transport service. The bulkheads of the
damaged compartment held and there was no leakage
through the water-tight doors.</p>

<p>It is regrettable that eight men lost their lives. The
coolness and resourcefulness of the acting master and
the engineer of the watch deserve commendation.
Cadet Officer David MacLaren was the youngest
officer on board—just eighteen years old. After I had
ordered the boats lowered, this lad, who was in charge
of one of them, would have been justified in leaving
the ship which he believed to be sinking, but he returned
to the bridge and reported to me that his boat
was lowered and clear of the ship and asked if he could
be of any service. He stayed on the bridge, giving valuable
assistance, and displaying courage and readiness
worthy of the best traditions of the sea.</p>

<p>One of the Navy youngsters was down in the living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
compartment cleaning up when the ship was struck.
Some one in a boat hanging at the davits, seeing him
hurry along the promenade deck, asked which boat
he belonged in.</p>

<p>“Number Four boat,” he replied.</p>

<p>“This is Number Four. Jump in,” urged the other,
and the boy answered:</p>

<p>“Not on your life! I’ve got to go to my gun.”</p>
</div>

<p>Unfaltering, the stricken <em>Finland</em> ploughed along
at fifteen knots with a great chasm in her side, while
the anxious <em>Corsair</em> and the destroyer <em>Smith</em> hovered
close and felt unspeakable relief when the
Ushant Light was seen on the port bow in the early
evening. Before midnight the <em>Finland</em> had passed
through the Raz de Sein and was safely anchored
in Morgat Bay, beyond reach of submarines.
Next morning her escort led her into Brest Harbor
and the <em>Finland</em>, <em>Smith</em>, and <em>Corsair</em>, three weary
ships, rested at the mooring buoys. The <em>Corsair</em>
courteously signalled the <em>Finland</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The officers and men of the <em>Corsair</em> express their admiration
of the spirit shown by your officers and men in
sticking by their ship and bringing her safely into port.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Finland</em> gratefully signalled back to the
<em>Corsair</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thank you. I congratulate the spirit and efficiency
of your command and thank you for the personal
assistance in a trying time.</p>
</div>

<p>Ships and men are much alike. Some are tenacious,
hard to knock out, standing punishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
and gallant in adversity. Others crumple under
defeat and surrender at one blow. The <em>Finland</em> had
a long record of faithful and successful service as
one of the favorite passenger steamers of the Red
Star Line between New York and Antwerp. She
had the reputation of having lived up to the expectations
of her builders. They had tried to make her
a staunch ship that would hang together. When the
cruel test came, the bulkheads stood fast, the
water-tight doors did their duty, and the concussion
failed to start the engines from the bed-plates.</p>

<p>The <em>Finland</em> was placed in dry-dock in France,
but mechanics were scarce and the work dragged.
Thereupon the American Army was called upon,
and from the ranks came riveters, structural workers,
machinists, who turned to and repaired the ship
in record time. The <em>Corsair</em> had been spared the
unhappiness of seeing this fine ship lost while under
her protection. And of all the ships which went in
and out while the <em>Corsair</em> was engaged in convoy
duty, it was her good fortune to behold only the
<em>Antilles</em> sunk by torpedo attack.</p>

<span class="fs80">ADMIRAL WILSON COMES TO BREST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">During</span> all this time the fleet of yachts had
gone clear of misfortune. In fog and mist and
blackness they were banging up and down the rock-bound
Breton coast amid ragged reefs and pinnacles,
through crooked passages, and over German
mine-fields. Offshore they dodged collisions by a
hair or steered where the “Allo, Allo,” of the wireless
submarine warnings indicated that the enemy
was active. Good luck and good seamanship had
saved them from disaster. It seemed as though these
yachts bore charmed lives, but the pitcher can go
too often to the well and the <em>Alcedo</em> was fated to be
the victim. She had often cruised with the <em>Corsair</em>
on escort duty, and between them there was bound
to be a feeling of companionship. In port the officers
and men had become acquainted, either visiting
aboard or meeting ashore. And together they had
stood by to aid the people of the <em>Antilles</em> and the
<em>Finland</em> at the risk of destruction by torpedo
attack.</p>

<p>The <em>Alcedo</em> left Quiberon Bay in the afternoon of
November 4th with a convoy bound to the United
States. In the middle of that same night, with
murky weather, the yacht was fairly blown to
pieces and twenty men were killed or drowned with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>no chance to try to save themselves. It was assumed
by the survivors, and quite plausibly, that in the
darkness the yacht might have been mistaken for
one of the transports by the commander of the
U-boat, who, if he knew his business, would have
preferred to pot one of the big troop-ships rather
than a small escort vessel.</p>

<p>Commander W. T. Conn, Jr., of the <em>Alcedo</em>, was
carried down with his ship, but somehow came to
the surface and fought his way clear of the suction
and the fearful confusion of <em>débris</em> and agitated
water. He described the disaster as almost instantaneous,
a disintegration of the yacht whose frames,
bulkheads, and plates must have been ripped apart
from end to end as though they were so much cardboard.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>While asleep in the emergency cabin immediately
under the upper bridge [said he], I was awakened by
a commotion and received a report from some man unknown,
“<em>A submarine, sir</em>.” I jumped out of the bunk
and went to the upper bridge where the officer of the
deck, Lieutenant Drexel Paul, informed me that he
had sounded general quarters at sighting a submarine
on the surface about three hundred yards on the port
bow, and that a torpedo had been fired. From the
port wing of the bridge I was in time to see the white
wake of the torpedo as it drove straight for the ship.
Lieutenant Paul had put the rudder full right before I
arrived, hoping to avoid the blow. The ship answered
slowly to her helm, however, and before any other
action could be taken I saw the torpedo strike the
ship’s side just under the forward port chain plates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>I was thrown down and dazed, for a few seconds, by
falling wreckage and torrents of water. On regaining
my feet, I sounded the submarine alarm on the siren
to call all hands if they had not heard the general alarm
gong, and to direct the attention of the convoy and
the other escorting vessels. I shouted to the forward
gun crews to see if they were at their stations, but by
this time the forecastle was awash. The foremast had
fallen, carrying away the radio aerial. I passed the
word to abandon ship.</p>

<p>I then left the bridge and went into the chart-house
to obtain the ship’s position from the chart, but the
lights had gone out and I was unable to see. Stepping
out of the chart-house, I met the Navigator, Lieutenant
Leonard, and asked him if he had been able to
send a radio and he said, “No.” I then went with him
to the main deck and told him to take charge of cutting
away the forward dories and life-rafts.</p>

<p>At the starboard gangway I stumbled over a man
lying face down. I rolled him over and spoke to him,
but received no reply and was unable to make out who
he was, as we were all in darkness. It is my opinion
that he was already dead. Moving to the after end of
the ship, I took station on a gun platform. The ship
was filling rapidly and her bulwarks amidships were
level with the water. I sung out to cut away the after
dories and life-rafts and throw them in the water, and
told the men near me to jump over the side.</p>

<p>Before I could follow them, however, the ship listed
heavily to port, plunging down by the head and sinking.
I was dragged down with her, but came up again
and swam to a life-raft to which three men were clinging.
We managed to lift ourselves upon it, and then,
looking around, I observed Doyle, chief boatswain’s
mate, and one other man in the whaleboat. We paddled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
over to them and crawled into the boat. It was
half-filled with water and we started to bale and to
rescue survivors from the wreckage. The whaleboat
was quickly crowded to capacity and no more could
be taken aboard. We then picked up two overturned
dories which were nested together, separated and
righted them only to find that their sterns had been
smashed. Presently we discovered another nest of
dories which were found to be seaworthy. We shifted
some of the men into them from the whaleboat and
proceeded to pick more men from the wreckage. During
this time, cries of distress were heard from others
adrift who had floated some distance away. Two of
them were believed to be Ernest M. Harrison, mess
attendant, and John Winne, seaman. We proceeded
to where they were last seen, but could find no trace of
them.</p>

<p>About this time, which was probably an hour after
the ship sank, a German submarine approached the
scene of the torpedoing and lay to near some of the
dories and life-rafts. No effort was made to assist the
men freezing in the water. Three Germans, presumably
the officers, were visible upon the top of the conning
tower as they stood and watched us. The U-boat
remained on the surface about half an hour and then
steered off and submerged. I then made a further
search through the wreckage to be sure that none of
my men were left in the water. At 4.30 in the morning
we started away from the scene to attempt to make
the nearest land.</p>

<p>The flare of Penmarch Light was visible and I
headed for it, observing the star Polaris and reckoning
the light to be about northeast. We rowed the boats
all through the forenoon and sighted the Penmarch
Lighthouse at 1.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Keeping steadily at the oars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
turn and turn about, we moved toward the coast until
5.15 in the afternoon when a French torpedo boat took
us aboard. There were three officers and forty men of
us, who were promptly carried into Brest, where I was
informed that two other dories, containing three officers
and twenty-five men, had landed at Penmarch
Point. This was the first news that these had been
saved, for they had not been seen by any of my party
near the place of the disaster.</p>
</div>

<p>It was true of the <em>Alcedo</em> that in the moment of
gravest crisis the cohesion and discipline of the
Navy manifested itself. Orders were given and
obeyed while the shattered yacht was dropping
from under the feet of the young men and boys who
had worn the uniform only a few months. It was a
nightmare of an experience in which panic might
have been expected, but officers and bluejackets
were groping to find their stations or endeavoring
to cut away boats so that others might be saved.
Such behavior was fairly typical of the patrol fleet,
although no other yacht was doomed to such a fate
as this, but there was the stuff in the personnel to
stand the test and the spirit of fidelity burned like
a flame.</p>

<p>The yachts had been playing the game lone-handed,
hoping to be reinforced by enough destroyers
to move the American convoys which were subjected
to long and costly delays in the French ports
for lack of escort vessels to carry them out through
the danger zone. The news that the United States
proposed to build two hundred destroyers sounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
prodigious, but it failed to fit the immediate occasion.
To the Queenstown base were assigned the
up-to-date oil-burning destroyers as fast as more of
them could be diverted from home, and they were
doing superb and indispensable service in cruising
a thousand miles offshore to meet and escort the
troop convoys in to France, but they could not
tarry to take the ships out again nor to protect the
slower supply convoys and undertake the other
work of the Breton Patrol.</p>

<p>The French coast was compelled to do the best
it could with the cards that were dealt. There was
no such thing as discouragement in the <em>Corsair</em> or
her sister ships, but the feeling grew that the job
was vastly bigger than the resources. It was singularly
cheering, therefore, when the flotilla of veteran
coal-burning destroyers came storming in from the
Azores, all stripped and taut and ready for business,
looking for trouble and unhappy until they could
find it. They became close kindred of the yachts,
sharing the rough weather cruises with the convoys
and, when in port, taking their doses of the dirty,
back-breaking work of eternally shovelling coal in
little baskets. And by the same token, their men
wore the common mark of the trade, the shadows
of grime beneath the eyes which soap and water
could never entirely remove. Yachts and destroyers
took orders from each other at sea and seldom
disagreed. The authority depended upon which
commander held the senior naval rank to qualify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
him to direct the movements of the patrol division.</p>

<p><em>Reid</em>, <em>Smith</em>, <em>Flusser</em>, <em>Lamson</em>, and <em>Preston</em>, they
were rated as no longer young and in size were
lightly referred to as the “flivver” class when
compared with the thousand-ton destroyers operating
out of Queenstown, while bets were made
that a winter in the Bay of Biscay would be too
much for them. But they stood the gaff and sailed
home again after the war, while the unterrified
crews bragged of the merits of their sturdy boats
and forgot all the hardships. Like the yachts they
had a sprinkling of college rookies among the bluejackets,
and of Reserve officers on the bridge, while
the Regular Navy leavened the lump.</p>

<p>When the November winds began to show their
temper, blowing strong from the west and north,
the <em>Corsair</em> had a foretaste of what the winter
service would be like. There happened to be no
one aboard who took the trouble to set down on
paper, in diaries or letters home, just what the life
was in the crowded compartments below decks
when the ship was bucking and rolling five hundred
miles offshore and the combers toppled green over
the bows. In the <em>Reid</em> destroyer, however, was a
young lawyer from Wisconsin, Timothy Brown,
who was not only a very able seaman, but also
something of an artist with a pen, and he managed
to convey very adequately what all these young
mariners put up with in order to make the seas safe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>for democracy. Almost word for word, he might
have been writing of the <em>Corsair</em>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A wave suddenly lifted us and I went down on my
right hip, sustaining severe contusions and abrasions,
not to mention a general shaking up. Our chief pharmacist’s
mate rushed up with a tourniquet, iodiform
gauze, and sticking plaster and asked me what I needed
worst. Thanking him, I made my way below and
moored to a stanchion for chow. I call attention to the
stanchions because our tureens, containing food and
silverware, were hitched to them while the rest of the
food was in aluminum platters which the mess cooks
surrounded as best they could with their feet and
knees. Occasionally a platter would get away from our
inexperienced mess cook of the Reserve Force and he
would dive across the compartment to nab it, only to
lose other dishes which he was safeguarding. The hungry
sailors would assemble the chow again, whereupon
each man would help himself and eat under whatever
endurable circumstances he could find.</p>

<p>Gentle reader, imagine yourself perched upon a
camp-stool with your face to port and your back to
starboard, at the seamen’s dining-table, trying to steer
a bowl of soup safely into your face. The ship rolls
forty-five degrees and your stool and soup bowl begin
to slide at the same time. You hold the edge of the
table with your left hand, clamp your spoon down
hard into the bottom of the bowl to secure it, then
cautiously push yourself to your feet, for the stool
threatens to carry you across the compartment in a
jiffy. The angle of the bowl now being constant with
the relation it bears to the table, the angle described
by the ship’s lurch spills half your soup. You quickly
release your grip on the table edge and take the soup<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
in both hands to steady it. This leaves the soup suspended
perfectly between zenith and nadir, fixed in its
relation to the bowl, if you don’t weaken. Your spoon
and slice of bread have been sliding all over the table,
kept from hitting the wet deck only by a wooden
flange. Before you can plan a campaign to absorb the
soup, your feet begin to slip and ere you can blink an
eye you have slid four yards across to the starboard
mess table, your feet tangled with a stool, and you
bump into a shipmate who turns loose his own soup
so that it fits perfectly down the back of your neck.</p>

<p>The other day a tureen of canned salmon skidded
off a near-by locker and landed under the starboard
table. The mess cook plunged after it, but missed it
by a hair. The tureen bounded into the lap of our
Irish oiler, who shouted gleefully, as he clutched it
with both hands, “I’ve got the bloody thing.” I was
reminded of a fat football player receiving the ball on
the kick-off in his centre of gravity and not knowing
what to do with it. The ship’s swing back upset our
hero and the salmon slipped away from him, landing
on the locker of a gunner’s mate and spoiling a brand-new
suit of liberty blues.</p>

<p>I had the misfortune, at this sad moment, to let a
ration of stew get away from me to the deck. There
was no use in staying below to hear the mess cook
rave, so I seized a cold potato between my teeth and
followed it madly all the way to the chart-house where
I feasted in peace. I was thankful to be alive, thankful
that I had a slippery deck to skate on, a speaking-tube
to cling to, and an oilskin coat which fitted so snugly
about my neck that not more than a quart of briny
water seeped into it every time our good ship did a
courtesy to the waves. Only a third arm could have
made me happier. Every sailor needs one in his business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>The deck continued to be a sort of good-natured
joggling board which playfully teased you, smashed
you, and tried to exterminate you. In another hour I
had contracted decorations on my knees that stuck
out like hens’ eggs, slivers of skin had been peeled off
my shins, and pains of various kinds convinced me
that, although my heart, lungs, and diaphragm were
still working, they had shifted from their accustomed
places. I had grown so feeble from underfeeding and
excitement that you could have knocked me flat with
a dried herring. It would have been an advantage to
go below and try to sleep, but the ship was as unsteady
down there and the stifling air was not tempting.</p>

<p>When it was time to go below, a sudden encounter
with a wave sent me to my hands and knees. Bethlehem
steel is hard, so I crawled the distance to the ladder
and fell to the quarter-deck, then fell down the
other ladder to the head of my bunk. Only one light
was burning and it was all wrapped up in black cotton
socks so the submarines couldn’t see us. I groped my
way into the bunk and removed my shoes, this being
an old custom with sailors, to rest the feet. Then I
stretched out and was ready for a few hours of slumber.
However, the waves continued to pound us and made
the night hideous. The machinery creaked and groaned
and a leaky steam-pipe kept whistling like a peanut
roaster. To stay in my bunk it was necessary to run
my arms beneath an elastic strap that goes over the
middle of the mattress and under the metal frame.</p>

<p>In this position I remained doggedly silent until
midnight when our watch was called again. I was so
sleepy that I remembered little of what happened during
the next four hours, except that at the end of it I
noticed a radio man swinging around a smokestack in
an effort to snag our flying wireless apparatus and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
it to rights again. After two or three hours more of
misery in the bunk, breakfast time came, with beans
and loaf bread on the menu, and I felt sure that I
would be lucky if I could stomach a single bean. Beans
didn’t look a bit good to me, yet I was forced to eat
something or I couldn’t stand another watch.</p>

<p>At the table we did not waste much time on etiquette.
To wash your face for breakfast during a gale
was considered a decided economic disutility, and we
didn’t care what place we occupied just so we got a
mouthful of grub. But one thing was always insisted
on, and that was for a man to remove his headgear
at meals. It didn’t make any difference whether a fellow
had any pants on or not, but he must not presume
to wear a white hat or a watch-cap. All hands would
howl him out of the compartment.</p>
</div>

<p>The foregoing fragment of a deep-sea idyll is
included in a war story of the <em>Reid</em> destroyer as
deftly compiled by George M. Beatty, Jr., one of
that dashing crew, and published with the title,
“Seventy Thousand Miles on a Submarine Destroyer.”
This young man was heartless enough to
print in the volume a ballad of his own devising
which had such things as these to say of the author
of this chronicle of the <em>Corsair</em>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>
<p>Soon after the flotilla of coal-burners came to
Brest, the whole scheme of American naval operations
in France took on a new aspect with the
arrival of Rear-Admiral Henry B. Wilson. He was
the man to perceive the vital need of expansion and
to create the organization so urgently required.
Outspoken yet tactful, with the hearty affability
of a sailor and the energy of a captain of industry,
Admiral Wilson proceeded to build upon the surmise
that the war might last three years and demand
an American army of four million men. The
pulse of the service quickened and the response
was loyal and instant.</p>

<p>It was not long before the executive offices of
the Admiral and his staff, in a tall building of Brest,
resembled the headquarters of a busy firm in Wall
Street. It was the centre of a network of communication
by wire and radio with the entire shore-line
of France, from Dunkirk to the edge of Spain, and
with the Allied naval chiefs of Paris, London, and
Washington.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> received her orders and did as she
was told, but guiding her movements was the complex
and far-flung activity of the secret intelligences
which revealed only the deductions and the results.
The Admiral’s changing charts were dotted with
tiny flags and lines of red ink which recorded, hour
by hour, the track of every German submarine that
stole seaward from Zeebrugge, and the plodding
courses of every Allied convoy that steered in hopes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of a safe haven. The decoding room unravelled the
messages that whispered by day and night from a
hundred sources, or caught and read the German
ciphers that were sent to the U-boat skippers far
out at sea.</p>

<p>Bit by bit was put together an organization of
equipment and personnel which extended from
Brest to a dozen other bases and separate patrol
divisions, each with its own subordinate commander.
Gradually it came to embrace such a list
of departments and responsibilities as these:</p>

<p>All this was not set in motion in a week or a
month. Admiral Wilson had to build almost from
the foundation. The French organization was depleted
and worn. Vice-Admiral Moreau and Rear-Admiral
Grout achieved everything in their power
to assist the American undertaking, with men,
ships, and material, but it was unfair to expect too
much of them. When the Queenstown destroyers
came into Brest and the officers found time to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>ashore, you might have heard them boast, in the
most gentlemanly terms, of the splendid efficiency
of their own base and the extraordinary ability of
Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, who directed their operations.
At this, an officer from the <em>Corsair</em> was likely
to fling back that the Queenstown outfit ought to
get on, with the vast resources of the British
Admiralty at its disposal and a base that had
nothing much more than a fleet of destroyers on its
mind. The whole French coast was cluttered up with
transports and cargo boats, from Brest to Bordeaux,
and it was some job to keep them moving, not to
mention chasing Fritz. And as for Admiral Sir Lewis
Bayly, K.C.B., he was said to be a fine old bird,
but he wasn’t the only two-fisted, “iron-bellied”
admiral in the war zone, and the doctrine of the
Breton Patrol was “Wilson, that’s all.” In such
manner was voiced the spirit of friendly rivalry
between the Navy men of Brest and Queenstown
and it was the kind of loyalty which you might
expect.</p>

<p>French opinion of the work of the American naval
forces found expression in the newspapers. Admiral
Wilson was held in the highest regard, personally
and officially, and <cite>L’Illustration</cite> said of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The indomitable will of our Allies is represented by
Admiral Wilson. He has a physiognomy which you
never forget. His quick manner of shaking your hand
while looking you squarely in the face, the smile which,
I dare say, follows up the orders he gives, his brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
and concise speech, denote a great firmness of character.
He knows what he is here for and what to do, and
as he wishes to carry on a big task properly he frees
himself completely of details,—on his desk are no
papers, no books, no litter of documents. He is precisely
aware of what he wishes to be done, and when he
has spoken his serenity shows that not for a second
does he doubt that he will be obeyed.</p>
</div>

<p><cite>La Dépêche</cite>, one of the journals of Brest, manifested
the cordial feeling of the city in stating:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Admiral Wilson is now a well-known figure among
us. He takes part in our daily life, shares in all our
sorrows as well as in our hopes. Later, without doubt,
the title of “Citizen of Brest” will be conferred upon
him. It is a pleasure to converse, if only by means of
an interpreter, with this fine mind which has a natural
tendency to action. He makes his resolutions without
embarrassing himself with paper work or useless formalities.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first week of November, the <em>Corsair</em> was
sent to England with a group of American ships
which were to join an outward-bound convoy
assembling at Mount’s Bay, Penzance. Quartermaster
Carroll Bayne mentioned this trip in his
diary, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>November 5th.</em> Penzance is very interesting. All sorts
of seaplanes, etc., flying about. I did not rate liberty,
but most of the men did and went ashore for a few
hours. I amused myself by holding a long conversation
with a naval quartermaster on a British yacht, the
<em>Venetia</em>, anchored near us. He was a good chap and a
typical “Limey,” with his “carry on” and “awfully.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
... <em>6th.</em> Left Penzance. Night very dark. We have in
the convoy, besides the four destroyers, the steamers
<em>Houston</em>, <em>Evangeline</em>, <em>Montanan</em>, and two others. The
<em>Clan Cummings</em> was to have come with us, but joined
the British convoy which left half an hour ahead of us.
She was torpedoed at 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> She was the biggest ship
in the whole flock and was right in the middle of sixty-five
other vessels. How the Germans do it, I can’t see.
We had a scare this morning when the <em>Evangeline</em> hit
something, either a mine or a wreck, or a submarine,
or a torpedo. We dashed around and stirred things up,
but there was no explosion or disturbance in the water.
We proceeded to Saint-Nazaire and anchored safely....
Had a great fight on board. The “Spic” cook got
into an argument with one of the firemen and it was
some set to. The cook drew a knife which Dave Tibbott
snatched away from him. The skipper took a hand
and he surely had a full head of steam.</p>
</div>

<p>Another trip out with empty transports and then
the <em>Corsair</em> was assigned to the escort of two of the
huge ships which were unlucky enough to be torpedoed
several months later, the <em>President Lincoln</em> and
the <em>Covington</em>. This time they passed safely through
hostile waters, and with them were the <em>Pennsylvania</em>,
<em>Nansemonde</em>, and <em>Neches</em>. When these towering
troop-ships began crowding into Brest, including
those which had been German liners, it was
significant of the fact that the American Army was
really moving into France. Instead of battalions
or regiments, the convoys were thenceforth to disembark
whole divisions, and Brest was to see from
fifteen thousand to forty thousand stalwart American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
soldiers pour out of one group of ships after
another. The responsibility of the escort vessels
was heavily increased, and officers and men thanked
God when one of these tremendous argosies had
been moored outside the breakwater without hindrance
or mishap.</p>

<p>It was while waiting for this convoy, just mentioned,
to be ready for sea, on November 16th, that
the <em>Corsair</em> became considerably agitated for fear
that Commander Kittinger had been lost or mislaid.
Quartermaster Bayne reflected the general
state of mind when he noted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Still in Quiberon Bay, waiting for the captain.
Everybody is getting worried as to what has happened
to him and the <em>Smith</em>. The scuttle-butt is full of rumors....
Tibbott, Houtz, Evans, Barry, and others are to
be sent home to get commissions, but not a chance for
me. The only thing, I guess, that our captain would
recommend me for is a firing squad.</p>
</div>

<p>Commander Kittinger was having troubles of
his own which may serve to convey an idea of the
little trials and tribulations which were apt to
beset the course of events in French seaports. In
language admirably restrained, considering the
provocation, he reported to Admiral Wilson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The escort commander left the <em>Corsair</em> and embarked
in U.S.S. <em>Smith</em> to make passage to Saint-Nazaire for
conference with the Naval Port Officer. Shortly after
passing du Four Light, the <em>Smith</em> was lost in the fog
and anchored about 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> A boat was lowered and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
by noon the ship was located as between Grand Charpentier
and Le Pierre Perce. At this time a strong ebb
tide was running which made navigation by dead
reckoning doubtful. The <em>Smith</em> also had on board the
French military pilot. Another attempt was made to
reach the mouth of the Loire, but the soundings indicated
shoal water and the ship was again anchored.
Finally, at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, the fog lightened sufficiently so
that the principal navigation lights were visible and
the ship got under way and anchored at Saint-Nazaire
at 11.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The fog again set in and continued
through the night.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, November 17th, I left the <em>Smith</em> to go
ashore to confer with the Naval Port Officer. At this
time the tide was running about five knots ebb and
the fog was so thick that objects could not be distinguished
for more than a hundred yards distant. The
boat missed the landing and fetched up on the beach
at Le Petit Taraict. I walked ashore and reported to
the Naval Port Officer about 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> He informed me
that he had no news, and calls were made at the Army
Base and upon the Commandant Marine. No information
of importance was obtained at the latter place.
Afterwards a call was made at the Bureau de Renseignements
which was found closed. An appointment
was made for me to get the latest news at this office at
1.00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Upon my return at that time the office was still
closed. About 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the fog lifted and I returned to
the <em>Smith</em> in the captain of the port’s launch. On going
aboard I found that urgent engine repairs were being
made which would delay the ship for two hours or
more. As it was impossible to get to Quiberon and
hold conference in time to move the convoy that night,
I decided to delay sailing until the following morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
An appointment was made for a visit at the Bureau
de Renseignements at 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> on the 18th, by the Naval
Port Officer. I reported at that time and found the
office was closed. I communicated by telephone with
the office of the Commandant Marine and received
no further news. Returned to <em>Smith</em> and got under way
for Quiberon.</p>
</div>

<p>Six months of service in the <em>Corsair</em> had hammered
most of the greenhorns into rough-and-ready
sailor-men who had come to know the ways of a
ship and the feel of the sea. A few still suffered and
were pallid about the gills when the waves rolled
high, but it was everlastingly to the credit of these
unfortunates that they made no effort to be shifted
to shore duty and were resolved to stick it out to
the bitter end. The war bred many kinds of heroes
and among them is to be rated the sailor who continued
to be seasick. One youth in the <em>Corsair</em> confessed
that he could never sleep below, but in all
weather, month after month, he curled up on deck,
in a boat, or wedged himself in odd corners, wet or
shivering, nor had he any other intention than to
stay with the ship until she flew her homeward-bound
pennant.</p>

<p>The enlisted personnel, in respect of intelligence,
ambition, and education, excelled the average of
the Regular Navy. This was bound to be true of a
Reserve Force recruited as this was. Many of them
were anxious to win promotion and to attain commissioned
rank. It was realized that the swift expansion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>of the Navy, with a strength of fifteen hundred
ships and four hundred thousand men already
in sight, had made the shortage of officers acute.
There was no prejudice against the Naval Reserve,
and from its ranks were chosen most of the ensigns
and lieutenants for the new fleets of destroyers and
submarine chasers, for the transports and the
armed guard of the merchant marine.</p>

<p>The word had passed through the <em>Corsair</em> that
examinations could be held and commissions
granted on board ship or at the base, and also that
applicants whose records merited it might be chosen
by the commander to go to Annapolis for the three
months’ intensive course which would turn them
out as temporary ensigns in the Regular Navy.
Some of the aspirants preferred to study while in
the ship and try to pass the tests, a little afraid
that if detached for Annapolis they might not be
sent back to the war zone.</p>

<p>It was inspiring to find the ship’s officers anxious
to assist these ambitions. The <em>Corsair</em> became more
or less of a nautical school. Earnest young men were
to be found frowning over problems and text-books
instead of playing cards at the mess tables or reading
old magazines. Those who had been in college
had a certain advantage in that they had been compelled
to make some sort of an acquaintance with
mathematics and were presumed to have acquired
the habit of study. It was the popular thing to
be a grind. Lieutenant McGuire and Chief Quartermaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
Shelton Fair showed keen interest in teaching
navigation and were very helpful to the pupils
who wrestled with the knotty points of the subject.</p>

<p>The novelty wore off, of course, and the laggards
fell by the wayside, for the requirements were stiff,
and dogged persistence and many a headache were
required to master the technique of the naval ensign’s
job. The reward was waiting, however, for
those who deserved it, and there was no taint of
caste or favoritism. The service was essentially
democratic, barring only the differences in station
which discipline demanded. Through the autumn
and winter, the <em>Corsair</em> was schooling a fine group
of ensigns for duty in other ships.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to explain what this course
included, as defined by the Bureau of Navigation
in a formidable document “Relative to Examinations
of Enlisted Men of Regular Navy for Appointment
as Ensigns for Temporary Service, also of
Certain Reservists and National Naval Volunteers
to Ensigns, Naval Reserve Force.”</p>

<p>In a general way the would-be ensign of the line

<span class="fs80">SMASHED BY A HURRICANE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the last day of November the <em>Corsair</em> got
under way from Brest to find and escort seven
American store-ships which were bringing cargoes
to France. A division of Queenstown destroyers
had picked them up at fifteen degrees West and
was guiding them to the rendezvous. With the
<em>Corsair</em> went the <em>Reid</em> and <em>Preston</em>, also three French
patrol craft, the <em>Glaive</em>, <em>Claymore</em>, and <em>Marne</em>. As
the senior officer, Commander Seiss, in the <em>Glaive</em>,
was in charge of the Allied escort group. The voyage
was without notable incident, but the difficulty
of working together in different languages and with
a mixed British and American convoy was indicated
by Commander Kittinger in his official
comment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The senior officer of our escort was in a ship lacking
efficient radio communication. As it is not to be expected
that an eight knot convoy from New York will
ever arrive at a rendezvous on a predetermined course
at a predetermined time, the Chief of Escort should
be in the vessel having the best communication. This
is especially necessary during the winter when the daylight
periods are short. I do not believe that the ships
of our convoy knew their destination. With ships on
their first trip, as most of these ships were, the masters
of the vessels are not prepared to have another escorting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
force join them and proceed to give them orders.
This is especially true in the case of the British ship
<em>Anglo-Saxon</em>, the master of which could not understand
why an American patrol vessel should tell him
to quit a British convoy. It would facilitate matters
if the masters of all vessels, were informed of their
destination and the probable time and place of their
detachment from the New York convoy.</p>

<p>The Chief of Escort did not require the ships to
zigzag nor to assemble in line formation as per doctrine.
I do not believe it is advisable for the Chief of Escort
to be a French officer acting with large convoys of
American and English ships.</p>
</div>

<p>After this cruise the <em>Corsair</em> was placed in dry-dock
at Brest, where a week was occupied in scraping,
painting, and such overhauling as was necessary.
The ship was in surprisingly good condition
after six months of far more severe and punishing
activity than she could have been reasonably expected
to perform. Chief Engineer Hutchison and
Assistant Engineers Mason and Hawthorn had kept
things running down below without a serious mishap
or delay, although the yacht’s engines had
shoved her through 19,427 miles of sea during this
half-year period. The fires had not died under the
boilers for a stretch of five months. It seemed no
longer quite fair to the <em>Corsair</em> to think of her as a
pleasure craft. The words were incongruous. She
had proved herself to be a brawny toiler of the sea.</p>

<p>An examination in dry-dock showed that the
hull was almost as undamaged as when the yacht<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
had sailed overseas. A few butts of the plates needed
calking. A small dent in the keel required new rivets
and two blades of the port propeller had been bent
by hitting something submerged. The crew very
much hoped that the obstruction might have been
the submarine which the ship attempted to ram on
that moonlit night of October.</p>

<p>On December 13th the Corsair <em>returned</em> to her
mooring buoy after this little respite in dry-dock
and undertook the sooty job of filling the bunkers.
Next day she stood to the southward and found a
convoy waiting in Quiberon Bay. There the transports
and supply-ships were split into two groups.
The escort of the fast convoy, fourteen knots, was
in charge of Commander Kittinger and comprised
the <em>Corsair</em> with the three destroyers, <em>Warrington</em>,
<em>Roe</em>, and <em>Monaghan</em>, which had been added to the
flotilla. The slow convoy escort, twelve knots, was
under the orders of Lieutenant Commander Slayton
in the <em>Reid</em>, who had with him the <em>Flusser</em>,
<em>Lamson</em>, <em>Smith</em>, and <em>Preston</em>. The whole destroyer
force then available was therefore employed on
this cruise, with the <em>Corsair</em> as the only yacht.</p>

<p>The German submarines had been creeping in to
lay mines in the channels outside of Quiberon, and
the yacht <em>Guinivere</em> and four American mine-sweeping
vessels were busy clearing the fairways
for the outward-bound convoys. In clear, pleasant
weather the two groups of transports gained the
open sea without running afoul of any mines and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
were well on their way by nightfall of December
15th. The sea was smooth, unseasonably so for the
time of year. The air had a nipping edge, but the
temperature was well above freezing and the deck
watches kept warm and dry in the wind-proof
clothing which the Navy supplied for this service.
The <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Monaghan</em> held positions on the
right flank of the transports <em>Madawaska</em>, <em>Occidente</em>,
and <em>Lenape</em>, while the two other destroyers trailed
or scouted off to the left.</p>

<p>There was no premonition of terrific weather.
For several days the barometer had been almost
steady, at 30.50 inches or thereabouts. During the
watch from eight o’clock to midnight of this first
day, the sky clouded and the breeze blew stronger,
hauling from northeast to north with steadily increasing
force. The barometer began to drop and
was at 30.00 when the watches were changed.
There came a lull in the early morning, the 16th,
when the rain squalls passed over, and with calm
water the convoy steamed at fourteen knots. The
<em>Corsair</em> was somewhat short-handed for this trip.
Lieutenant Tod, the navigator, had been granted
leave of absence to go to the United States and
Lieutenant McGuire was acting in his stead. Boatswain
Rocco Budani was also absent on leave.</p>

<p>By noon of this second day the wind had risen
again, and this time it was boisterously in earnest,
with a weight that swiftly tore the sea into foam
and tumbled it in confusion. The barometer was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
still “falling gently,” as noted in the ship’s diary,
and hung at 29.30 until the weather was at its worst.
The <em>Corsair</em> pluckily clung to her station with the
tall transports until 2.30 in the afternoon, although
the seas had begun to pile on board of her. The destroyers
of this escort group concluded to turn tail
to it and run for shelter before the storm increased
to hurricane violence, but the five other destroyers
with the twelve-knot convoy, the <em>Smith</em>, <em>Reid</em>,
<em>Lamson</em>, <em>Flusser</em>, and <em>Preston</em>, stubbornly held on
and so were fairly caught in it along with the
<em>Corsair</em>.</p>

<p>When it became impossible to smash ahead any
longer without suffering serious damage, every
effort was made to signal the senior naval officer of
the transports, by semaphore and flag hoists, but
no response could be made out. The big ships,
riding high, were able to snore through the wicked
seas at ten or twelve knots, but the yacht and the
wallowing destroyers had to slow down and ease
up or be swept clean.</p>

<br>

<p>Aboard the <em>Corsair</em> it was decided to make for
Brest as a refuge, but this course brought the sea
too much abeam, as was discovered after three
hours of reeling progress which slowed to ten knots.
When the afternoon darkened into dusk, the shouting
gale had so greatly risen in fury that it menaced
destruction. The destroyers had vanished in
the mist and murk, endeavoring to save themselves
and fairly rolling their funnels under. The Bay of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>Biscay earned an evil reputation long, long ago,
but very seldom does it brew such wild weather as
this great blow of December, 1917. French pilots
and fishermen could recall no storm to match it in
twenty years.</p>

<p>It was the supreme test for the <em>Corsair</em>, a yacht
which was, after all, handicapped for such a struggle.
Officers and men prepared her to face it as best
they could, but she could not be “battened down”
like the rugged ship that is built to tramp the world.
The deck-houses, contrived for comfort and convenience,
presented an expanse of large windows
and mahogany walls and were exposed to the battering
of the seas. There was no passageway below
to connect the fore and after parts of the yacht.
As a war-vessel, she was already stripped of all
extra fittings, and all that could be done was to
make everything secure and meet it in the spirit
of that famous old chantey of the Western Ocean:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“She is bound to the west’ard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Where the stormy winds blow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Bound away to the west’ard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Good Lord, let her go!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The medium-sized destroyers, like the <em>Reid</em> and
<em>Preston</em>, which also weathered this hurricane, had
a narrow beam and a shallow draft that made
them roll terrifically, but, on the other hand, they
could be sealed up like bottles, and they dived
through it with no great risk of foundering even
when swept from end to end. With less than half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the tonnage of the <em>Corsair</em> they had ten thousand
horse-power to whirl their triple screws. The decks
might be washed clean of gear, but there were no
houses to be knocked to pieces. The popular fancy
that the destroyer is a fragile craft was disproved
in the war zone. There were no more seaworthy,
tenacious ships afloat.</p>

<p>Concerning what happened during this black
night when the <em>Corsair</em> seemed to be washing to
pieces and her holds were flooding, there were various
versions and opinions. Most of the youthful
landsmen, convinced that the yacht was going to
the bottom, were frightened out of a year’s growth
and not in the least ashamed to admit it. If they
said their prayers, it was to be counted in their
favor. The professional seafarers had their own
misgivings, but with the stubborn, unreasonable
confidence of their kind, they somehow expected to
pull her through, believing in the ship as long as
she was able to float. This was particularly true of
Lieutenant Commander Porter, who had lived with
the <em>Corsair</em> for so many years that she was almost
a part of himself. He knew her moods, her strength
and her weakness, and because she had never failed
him he could not have been persuaded that she was
unable to survive.</p>

<p>Man has contrived many cunningly ingenious
structures, but none of them nobler than a staunch
and well-found ship. The <em>Corsair</em> was a shell of thin
steel plates, but every line and curve and hollow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
of them had been influenced by the experiences of
centuries of warfare with the sea. A good ship is,
in a way, the heritage from unnumbered builders
who, patiently, intelligently, wrought in wood by
rule of thumb to fashion the frames and timbers
and planking of frigates and barks and stately clippers
long since vanished. The <em>Corsair</em> was given
beauty, to a sailor’s eye, but there was more than
this—the indomitable quality of resistance which
is like the will to endure.</p>

<p>What may be called the professional language of
mariners is curiously restrained and matter-of-fact.
It is to be found in the pages of ship’s log-books,
which are, as a rule, the dryest possible reading.
This hurricane, for instance, in which so many
amazing and heart-quaking things happened, in
which the <em>Corsair</em> all but foundered, is dismissed in
such entries as these, so far as the ship’s record is
concerned:</p>

<p>The war diary compiled by Commander Kittinger
for the Navy Department is somewhat more
explicit, but displays no signs of emotion. One begins
to catch glimpses of the situation, however,
and even to conclude that this intrepid naval officer
would have felt much safer ashore. He also commits
himself to the statement that the wind blew with
hurricane force. A sailor will seldom go as far as
this. When he does, you may be sure that old
Boreas is giving the ship about everything he has
in stock. What the agitated land-lubber calls a
storm, and refers to it as a narrow escape, the
skipper jots down as “a strong breeze”; or if it
blows hard enough to snatch the hair from a cat’s
back he may stretch a point and log it as a “moderate
gale.” There seems to have been no disagreement
among the experts that the <em>Corsair</em> poked her
nose into a <em>bona-fide</em> hurricane, to be certified as
such.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was believed at this time, 8.25 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> [states the
commander’s report], that the storm had reached the
maximum and in a few hours it would moderate and
permit shaping the course and returning to the base.
The sea kept getting higher and higher and speed was
reduced to six and then to five knots. The ship steered
poorly and it was necessary to use the engines to keep
her headed to the sea. At 9.20 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> took a heavy sea
over port side which stove in the deck-house abreast
the engine-room hatch. The sea was kept about one
point on the starboard bow to prevent taking water
in large quantities down the engine-room hatch. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
gangways were awash and it was impossible to keep
water from going down the breach.</p>

<p>The condition of the wind and sea did not improve
and at 2.55 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, December 17th, a heavy sea broke
forward and completely carried away the hatch covering
of No. 2 hatch and demolished the forward bulkhead
of the forward deck-house and stove in the roof
forward to about half way aft. This admitted great
quantities of water below and conditions became
dangerous.</p>

<p>Two French mines were washed overboard which
exploded about two minutes apart. These mines had
been set in a safe position and were inspected before
dark. Apparently the safety pins had worked out of
position during the buffeting of the heavy seas. The
others stowed on deck were inspected and it was found
that some of the safety pins had worked out of position.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the ship turned and ran before wind and
sea. The water below had gotten about one foot over
the engine-room floor plates but was soon under control.
The ship made better weather but was by no
means out of danger. Fortunately no seas broke over
the stern although quantities of water were taken over
which came through the after skylights which had
been damaged earlier. At daylight the next morning
it was found that a great deal of damage had been done
to all skylights, deck-houses, boats, and deck fittings,
and that both the after deck-houses had been started
on the port side.</p>

<br>

<p>At 10.00 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> took a heavy sea over starboard
quarter which stove in the starboard side of the engine-room
deck-house. The wind and sea continued. It was
evident that the ship would not reach a French port
as her safety lay in running before the sea. At noon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>got a doubtful fix by observation and shaped course
to pass west of Finisterre. At 3.00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> got a good fix
by observation which verified the course. At 12.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
December 18th, passed Cape Villano abeam, distance
eight miles.</p>

<p>Consideration was given to a port of refuge. The
nearest available Allied port was Lisbon which could
not be reached until nightfall. As there was no information
concerning entrance to this port, nor a code
for radio communication, I decided to make Vigo,
Spain, and rest there until Lisbon could be made by
daylight. Anchored the ship at Vigo at 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and
communicated with the American Consul and with the
Spanish Military, Naval, and Health authorities. Received
weather reports and other information.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> got under way and arrived off Lisbon about
8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, December 19th. Took a pilot on board and
obtained permission to enter port at Cascaes Bay.
Moored to buoy off Lisbon at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Got into
communication with the Portuguese Naval authorities
who viewed the damage and said that repairs could be
effected without difficulty. At 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, December 20th,
took berth alongside of dock at Naval Arsenal and
started repairs.</p>
</div>

<p>In their own diaries and letters home, the men
of the <em>Corsair</em> managed to get more excitement out
of the hurricane than one might infer from the
tabloid narrative of the skipper. There were unusual
features, such as the explosion of the depth
charges which washed overboard and “functioned
perfectly,” blowing up so close astern that many
of the crew supposed the yacht had hit a German
mine or the boilers had gone up. Other “ash cans”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
were adrift on deck, thumping about with the
drunken motion of the ship or unreeling the cable
which detonated them. In the tumult and commotion
of wind and sea, petty officers and seamen
groped to find these perilous metal kegs, diving
after them as though they were so many footballs
and trying to hold them fast.</p>

<p>Dave Tibbott, for example, was discovered with
a depth charge jammed against his stomach while
he clung to it and the rail. E. L. Houtz won a letter
of commendation from the Secretary of the Navy
for clambering down into the blackness of the lazarette
and hoisting out a depth charge which had
plunged into this compartment when the hatch
cover was washed off. The cable had unwound and
he followed it down, hand over hand, so locating
the infernal machine. He floundered about with it,
managing to get a footing upon some boxes, and
so hung on by the eyelids until comrades could
help him and his burden up the ladder. One of the
quartermasters wrote his own impressions, somehow
finding a dry spot in which to use a pencil:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>December 16th</em>. Pretty heavy sea, and gale blowing
and hitting us hard. At 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> asked permission of the
convoy to leave for Brest before the big storm breaks.
<em>Later.</em> This may be the last entry I’ll ever make. We
are in a hurricane and a mountainous sea. Unable to
proceed without swamping and are now hove to in the
teeth of the gale, barely making headway. The water
is about four feet deep on the decks.... <em>17th.</em> A terrible
day and none of us expected to live through it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
At 2.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> there was an awful crash and then a flood
of water poured below. We all thought she had foundered
and fought our way to the topside through water
and wreckage.</p>

<p>I had just reached the deck when there was a tremendous
explosion and the ship took a bad list. Water
poured in everywhere. I heard some one yell, “My
God, we’re torpedoed,” but I thought it was one of
the boilers. Some of the men were manning the boats,
and I had some battle to get to my station on the
bridge without being washed off like a chip. I had just
climbed to the bridge when there was another explosion,
and a flash. My first thought was that we had
struck a mine-field and then I heard one of the officers
say that our own mines were going off.</p>

<p>Ensign Schanze ran aft to see if our stern was gone
and found the watch chasing loose mines all over the
deck. As fast as they were caught, the detonators were
removed and they were pitched overboard to get rid
of them. I stood at my post on the bridge expecting
the ship to sink under my feet at any minute. I had
made up my mind not to try to go in a lifeboat on
account of the size of the sea, but to grab something
wooden if I could. At this time a heavy rain squall
swept over us. When I saw that the ship was not sinking,
I went below to the engine-room to get warm.</p>

<p>I found conditions pretty serious there, with two
feet of water around the engines and the engineers and
firemen working in water up to their knees. The word
was passed that we had turned and were running before
the sea, and as long as the waves did not start
breaking over the stern we could stay afloat. At 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
the seas got worse and began coming over. First to go
was the engine-room bulkhead. It caved in with a
frightful crash. Our radio also went down. Things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
looked mighty unpleasant, believe me, and after a conference
with the executive officer, our commander
decided to run straight ahead and try to fetch the coast
of Spain. It was our only chance to save our skins, so
we plugged ahead at a few knots.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the seas rose sixty feet high,
at a safe guess, and began combing over our stern
again. The after bulkheads were now giving way and
it looked like our finish. The skipper had passed the
word for all hands to turn to and save ship. We tore
down doors, lockers, anything for lumber, and set to
work reinforcing bulkheads. As soon as one carried
away, we built another. The deck had tons of water
on it and was leaking badly. Also the fire-room was
filling up. The pumps were set going and we kept about
even with the water. It was a flip of a coin whether we
would win through and every man was fighting for his
life.</p>

<p>At 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the wind and sea decreased a little and the
water stopped coming over. At 10 o’clock we sighted
the lighthouses on the Spanish coast and felt that we
had better than an even break of getting into port.
It was a tough experience, one that we don’t care to
repeat, and the poor old <em>Corsair</em> is all in, pretty much
of a wreck barring her hull and engines. The ship’s
company are a smashed-up, tired-out lot. There is
hardly a man aboard without an assortment of bruises.
My back is almost broken.</p>

<p>Throughout the ship men were endeavoring to
do their duty and to perform the allotted tasks,
just as this quartermaster had struggled to his
station on the bridge when he thought that the
<em>Corsair</em> had been blown up. When one of the boats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>was in danger of being whisked away by a breaking
sea, young Henry Outwater climbed into it and
rove new falls, sticking to it until he had finished
the job of working the stiff rope through the blocks.
He was under water part of the time, and the fury
of the wind was such that “he whipped straight
out like a pennant,” as he afterwards told his
mates. At any moment he and the boat were likely
to go careering off together on the back of a thundering
sea. No officer of the <em>Corsair</em> would have
ordered him to risk his life in this fashion. He did
it because he thought it ought to be done, a detail
in the line of duty. The same spirit was shown by
Boatswain’s Mate Mulcahy, who noticed that the
port anchor needed to be secured. The ship was
plunging her bows clean under as he crawled forward
and fought the smothering seas while he
wrestled with the lashings.</p>

<p>It was bad enough on deck, but worse to be far
down below in the engine- and fire-rooms where the
black water swashed to and fro and rose higher and
higher. The pumps had choked with coal and ashes
and it was touch and go before they were finally
cleared. In this immensely difficult task, working
mostly under water, Carpenter’s Mate Evans
bravely helped to free the bilge suctions. Engineers,
oilers, water-tenders, and the grimy watches of the
furnace gang had dumbly, courageously run the
chance of death by a torpedo through voyage after
voyage. Now the sea had become an enemy even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
more ferocious than the U-boat, showing every
intention of drowning them where they stood; but
these were no quitters and the ship had steam
enough to hold her hove to or to send her surging
off before it. They were alert and steady for the
signals from the bridge and they kept the heart of
the ship beating strong and responsive to the need.</p>

<p>The twin screws helped to steer her, now with a
thrust to starboard, again with a kick to port,
whenever the hurricane would have rolled her
helpless. One of the bridge watch, yarning about it
in Lisbon, recalled this incident:</p>

<p>“I went below to roost on the steam pipes and
thaw out, and you couldn’t call that outfit excited
at all. What made a hit with me was a kid of an
oiler who stood in the water between the two throttles,
with a grip on each of ’em while he nursed the
engines along. He had to help steer the ship as he
got the word, opening up a little on one, shutting
off on the other. Getting drowned was the least of
his worries. All he had on his mind was coaxing the
ship as she needed it, and the water was splashing
around his legs, at that.”</p>

<p>“It reminds me,” chipped in another of this
reminiscent group. “In the morning of the big blow,
a guy of my division appeared on deck all dressed
up in his liberty blues. The bo’s’n’s mate asked him
what he meant by turning out all dolled up like
that. ‘Why, Jack,’ answered this cheerful gob, ‘I
have a date with a mermaid in Davy Jones’s locker.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“Like a couple of huskies of the black gang,” said
some one else. “They were in their bunks snoring
away like a pair of whistling buoys, dead to the
world, although the fo’castle was flooded and the
water was sloshing under ’em. The hurricane had
worked itself up and was going strong, but they
were off watch and the important business was to
pound their ears. The first depth charge exploded
and shook the ship up, and all hands were beating
it for the deck, leaving their clothes behind. These
two birds rolled over and sat up and yawned. ‘Say,
bo, do you suppose we’re torpedoed?’ observes one,
sort of casual-like. ‘It sounds and feels like that
same little thing,’ replies the other. ‘I guess we
might as well dress and see what it looks like.’ They
were calm and deliberate, just like that, waiting to
put on their shoes and pea-jackets and oilskins, and
sort of strolling topside. My theory is that they
had dreamed of being torpedoed and talked about
it until the real alarm had no pep to it at all.”</p>

<p>“Do you fellows remember this? Somebody
found ‘Tex’ on his knees, just after the whole wet
ocean spilled into the after hatch. He was not a
prayerful man, as a rule, so the spectator stood by
to listen to ‘Tex’ at his supplications. He wasn’t
praying for his own life, but for the safety of
Shelton Farr who had tried hard to make ‘Tex’
follow the course of a virtuous sailor. ‘Oh, Lord,
don’t bother about me, but save Fair,’ was the
petition. ‘He is entirely too good to die.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“I said my prayers earnest and often,” confessed
a stalwart gunner’s mate. “On the whole, the crowd
behaved pretty darn well. I happened to see two or
three boys sort of sticking to each other for comfort,
and there were tears in their eyes and maybe
one did blubber a little, but they were mere kindergarten
infants, sixteen or seventeen years old, and
it was a rough deal to hand ’em. A quartermaster
came off watch from the bridge and one of these
babies stopped him to ask what the skipper and
Captain Porter thought about it. ‘They say the
ship is going to pull through,’ the quartermaster
tells these children. That was all they wanted to
hear. They bucked right up and began to grin.”</p>

<p>To have the deck-houses smashing about their
ears was enough to make the battered crew unhappy,
but the most serious accident was the loss
of the heavy round hatch plate which covered the
entrance to the store-room or lazarette. Into this
opening the sea poured in torrents as it broke and
roared aboard, and it might have sunk the ship in
a short time. You may be able to fancy how they
labored to plug this hole with anything that came
handy, while searching parties crawled and groped
to find the missing hatch plate. Never was a game
of hide-and-seek so desperately energetic. Luckily
the metal cover had not gone overboard and before
the holds filled with water it was found and screwed
down to stay.</p>

which had been pried up by the sea, and the seaman
who found it eyed the oaken board in a pensive
manner as he said:</p>

<p>“Truer words were never spoken. The old boat
has sailed every which way in the last two days,
including upside down, and you can take it from
me that there’s been nothing restful about her,
nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Ensign Schanze tried to tell what happened when
next he wrote to the folks at home and he succeeded
very well, adding details and touches which
might otherwise have been overlooked:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Picture to yourself the situation of a ship partly
filling with water, at three o’clock in the morning, in a
storm of ever-increasing violence, everybody on board
wet and cold and exhausted, and then suddenly having
a few beer-kegs loaded with dynamite going off just
astern of her. It was a five-reel thriller and no mistake.
We took the seaman’s forlorn hope of turning in that
sea and trying to run before the storm, and we got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
away with it. The danger in that point of sailing lies
in the possibility of having a sea board you from astern,
and when that happens the ship usually founders.</p>

<p>When I say that the <em>Corsair</em> was wet, I mean wet,
not merely moist. There was not a deck or a room in
her, excepting the chart-house, which had at any time
less than six inches of water sloshing about in it. At
the instant just preceding the big smash that made us
turn tail, I had left the bridge to go aft and look the
ruins over. The big sea that squashed us, after doing
its dirty work, rushed aft just as the ship rose to climb
the next oncoming wave. At that moment I had
reached the foot of the ladder that leads from the
lower bridge to the main deck. As she was rolling hard
and had a foot of water all over that deck, I was hanging
to the hand-rail that runs along the deck-house.
I heard the crash and knew what was stepping in my
direction, so I clawed onto the hand-rail with both
hands. The water came racing aft and piled up against
my back until I was in a depth of at least six feet. My
hold on the rail was useless and I was carried down
the deck about a hundred feet in a most undignified
attitude, to wit—in a posture halfway between sitting
and lying on my back. Just as I regained my feet,
the first mine went off. You can imagine my thoughts
on the subject.</p>

<p>As it was out of the question to sleep in any of the
regular living quarters, our men clustered around the
engine-room hatch and in the blower-rooms and got
what sleep they could in that manner. None of the
officers got any sleep for thirty-six hours. At one time,
when we were running before the storm, I looked into
one of the blower-rooms and saw a man seated in about
six inches of water, fast asleep. Tommy, the ship’s cat,
was asleep in his lap. A comber boarded us over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
side and increased the depth of water so that the next
roll of the ship got Tommy very wet. He jumped from
a sound slumber in the man’s lap to a wide-awake and
frightened posture upon the man’s shoulder. Another
sea climbed aboard to disturb poor Tommy again, so
he perched himself upon the man’s head and there he
stayed for two hours.</p>

<p>I saw Commander Porter get into an argument with
a big boarding sea and my next view showed him lying
alongside the outer rail in water two feet deep. There
is no sense in arguing with a sea like that. One must go
where it takes him and be glad when he is jammed
into a secure corner.</p>

<p>Several boxes and packages came aboard for me
just before this trip, each marked “To be Opened on
Christmas,” so I carefully stowed them away. The
hurricane flooded my room, of course, and drenched all
my precious holiday packages. Despite the big flood,
everything came through in fairly good order, barring
the Christmas cakes, which turned into a beautiful
clinker after they had been dried out on a steam radiator.
Now we have to dig them apart with an ice-pick.</p>

<p>The walnuts and Brazil nuts sent by my loving
friends did very well in the storm. They went adrift
early in the excitement and got caught in the bilge
strainer during the time we were pumping the water
out of the ship. The chief engineer found them all when
he put on his diving suit to see what kept the pumps
from working, and I claimed the whole bunch, knowing
full well they were mine. Several odd socks also mingled
with the bilge strainer, but they were not mine.
The captain, Gray, and I had a nut party in my room
on Christmas night and very much enjoyed the bilged
nuts.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>Yeoman Connolly was not likely to forget the
night of the storm which caused him to say of his
own emotions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All went well, except for a few seas we took over the
side, until three o’clock Monday morning. I was in my
bunk below decks at the time and, by the way, all I
had on in the line of clothing was my underwear and
the heavy sweater sent me from home. It was the first
time since the day I watched the <em>Antilles</em> go down that
I had turned in without all my clothes on. We figured
that we were free from the danger of submarine attack
in such a rough sea, hence our “nighties.” I fell asleep
about midnight and was slumbering peacefully when I
heard and felt an explosion and woke to find everybody
making for the hatches. Dazed, I ploughed
through about four feet of water, almost naked, and
popped on deck. There it looked to me as though the
old ship had been almost blown in two. Deck-houses
and hatches were all messed up and the yacht seemed
to be slowly settling. We made for the boats only to
find them smashed, and then waited for orders.</p>

<p>The cry went round, “All hands save ship,” and if
you hear that once you’ll never forget it. By this time
I had scooted through the yeoman’s office and grabbed
enough clothing together so I could lend a hand on the
topside. It was the coolness of the officers and men
that saved us from watery graves. We tore apart every
table and door below decks to mend things until we
could make port. I don’t believe the ship will ever go to
sea again, except that she may be put in good enough
shape to take us back to France from Lisbon about
the middle of February or thereabouts.</p>
</div>

<p>Of the destroyers which were caught offshore and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
rode out the hurricane, the <em>Reid</em> was blown into
Oporto, severely knocked about. Her log recorded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>December 17th.</em> Torpedo truck carried away and
washed overboard. Lost machine lathe and wherry.
Whaleboat smashed and ice-box, life-preserver locker
and vegetable locker broken loose by seas breaking
aboard. Lost life-buoy light, compass binnacle light,
guard to wheel chains, etc. 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to noon, steaming as
in previous watch. Having serious main engine bearing
trouble, due to salt water in lubrication system. At
9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> passed U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> close aboard and asked
her to stand by and assist us back to Brest. (<em>Corsair</em>
had answered our S.O.S. from near by.) Lost sight of
<em>Corsair</em> at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, due to rain squalls and heavy
weather. Foot of water in firemen’s compartment
through hatch, and engine-room and all other compartments
flooded.</p>
</div>

<p>The engine-room log of the <em>Reid</em> makes interesting
reading, for the <em>Corsair</em> was in much the same
plight:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Heavy sea swept over engine-room hatch at 4.30
<span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, carrying away ventilators and lathe and flooding
engine-room. Glass covering to oil manifold carried
away and settling tank flooded. Bearings running
warm. Too much water running from sea.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Smith</em> destroyer lost both masts and a fireman
overboard who was rescued after an hour when
the cook swam to him with a line. The paint locker
was stove in and the yeoman’s office washed out,
which meant the loss of many painful hours of
paper work. The vessel spent two weeks in dry-dock<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
in Brest. The <em>Roe</em> and the <em>Monaghan</em> were
nearer the coast, and although each lost a mast
they scudded for shelter in time to avoid the worst
of the blow. The <em>Flusser</em> and the <em>Warrington</em> were
badly battered and had to lay off for repairs. The
<em>Preston</em> limped into <em>Lisbon</em>, sighting the <em>Corsair</em>
just outside the port, and the two ships remained
there together until they could be made fit for sea
again.</p>

<p>That lively historian of the <em>Reid</em>, Seaman (later
Lieutenant) Timothy Brown, added some bits of
life in a storm which the crew of the <em>Corsair</em> considered
appropriate to their own unhappy hours:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the elements continued to harry us, I could
notice a changing sentiment among certain members
of the crew. Several expressed the opinion that she
would soon break in two in the middle. It was only
a question of time. Others were too far gone to have
any opinion about anything, and these afflicted ones
lay helpless, clutching at whatever they could gain a
hold. They were attended by their close friends. Our
lawyer clung to a table and scribbled on a pad. He was
framing a poor devil’s will. A brave lad from the Middle
West suggested that it might be well to throw out some
ballast—too much water was flowing through the
hatches to feel comfortable. He said we might spare a
ton or two from the forward hold which was crammed
with provisions. A deck-hand passed the buck to the
engineering department, which he said was about to
sink the ship with enough truck to outfit several auxiliary
cruisers, including solder bars, sal ammoniac,
bolts and nuts, brass unions, rat-tail files, tallow candles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and flake graphite. None of the engineering department
people would give up a pound. The only
volunteer was a seaman who said, if necessary, he
could spare a guitar.</p>

<p>... I reached the bridge deck unobserved and was
drinking in the glorious sight. It felt fine to be so high
that nothing could hit you but the spray. I hooked
my elbow around a metal support of the searchlight
platform. The officers had no good hand-holds and
were slipping about like drunken men on roller skates.
Our captain was almost unrecognizable in a saffron-colored
slicker that hung down to his heels, and on his
head was perched a sou’wester to match. He reminded
me of the old salt who swings an enormous fish over
his shoulder and advertises cod liver oil. Our junior
lieutenant appeared to have unusually good sea legs,
for he could stand with his arms folded, shifting from
foot to foot, stolid and Napoleon-like. Our ensign was
staggering under the weight of a life-preserver and a
number of coals, all bundled up like an Eskimo, nothing
showing but his eyes. Our chief petty officers, hanging
under the wings of the chart-house, had not shaved
for days and looked as if they might have made good
if given a try-out as modern Captain Kidds. Grotesque
figures draped in horse-cloth outer clothing, topped
with hoods, aviator style, hovered wherever they could
find a corner.</p>
</div>

<p>Blown far away from her base port in France, the
<em>Corsair</em> was thankful to find shelter in the Spanish
harbor of Vigo as a brief respite. She could not be
called crippled, as a matter of fact, for in a rough
sea she picked up speed to twelve knots and so made
a landfall. Her condition was that of a pugilist with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
a broken nose, blackened eyes, and a few teeth
missing, who still “packs a punch” and has no
idea of taking the count. The <em>Corsair</em> no longer
resembled a trim, taut, and orderly ship of the
American Navy, nor would her weary crew have
cared to line up for an admiral’s inspection. They
wore whatever clothes they could lay hands on,
and might have spilled out of the fo’castle of a
Cardiff collier. All that really concerned them was
the hope of getting dry and eating a few regular
meals.</p>

<p>There were obvious reasons why Commander
Kittinger preferred to seek some other port than
Vigo in which to repair and refit for several weeks.
The American Consul warned him that the Spanish
authorities were bound by the laws of neutrality to
intern the ship until the end of the war, a fact of
which he was well aware. On the other hand, the
senior Spanish naval officer of the port waived such
formalities aside and most courteously assured the
<em>Corsair</em> that she would not be meddled with and
was at liberty to remain for necessary repairs and
to depart when they were completed.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Without doubting his word in the least, it was
common knowledge that pro-German sentiment
was strong in the Spanish ports and the enemy’s
espionage system extremely well organized. Lisbon
was near at hand and Portugal was an active ally
of the United States. The <em>Corsair</em>, therefore, went
to sea, after a few hours at Vigo, and steamed into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>the wide bay of the Tagus next morning and so
found a friendly destination and a people who
welcomed her with warmest hospitality to one of
the most beautiful cities of the world.</p>

<p>The war had touched it lightly. The contrast
with France, so tragic and worn and imperilled, was
singularly impressive. Brilliant with sunshine,
Lisbon smiled from her seven hills and her tropical
gardens, and the seafarers of the <em>Corsair</em> thought of
Brest, gloomy and rain-swept, given over to the
business of war, the gateway of the thronging transports
which were hurrying the manhood of America
by the million, to the blood and misery of the
trenches.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">M. A. DeWolfe Howe</span></p>
<br>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Portuguese</span> troops were fighting in France
and the sentiment of the people was very
strongly with the Allied cause. They realized that
the hope of ultimate victory lay in the tremendous
energy with which the United States had finally
hurled itself into the war, but there had been no
opportunity to behold and applaud the valiant
soldiers from across the seas. Now, at length, there
came into the harbor of Lisbon two war vessels of
the powerful Uncle Sam, a large and graceful yacht
and a bulldog of a destroyer, and the blue-clad
sailors who flocked ashore were the first to set foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
there since Portugal had entered the war. The
<em>Corsair</em> and the <em>Preston</em> were something more than
storm-tossed ships in quest of a haven. To Lisbon
they were a memorable event and one worthy of a
celebration.</p>

<p>The colony of foreign diplomats and military
officers, British, French, American, Spanish, and
all the rest, accepted the entertainment of the
American officers and sailors as a social responsibility.
And they were quick to recognize the fact that
in the war-time American Navy the “gob” was as
likely to be a young gentleman of manners and
education as the ensign or the lieutenant. Tactfully
and easily the barriers of shipboard discipline and
ceremony were ignored for the time, and the invitations
to teas, garden parties, receptions, and theatres
seldom raised lines of distinction between the
youthful seaman with the flat cap and the rolling
collar, and the gold-striper severely buttoned to
the neck in his service blouse. This might have
been awkward in some circumstances, but the crew
of the <em>Corsair</em> knew how to carry it off. They met
the loveliest girls of Lisbon and were gallantly
attentive, as was quite proper.</p>

<p>The American Minister to Portugal, Colonel
Thomas Birch, fairly adopted the whole ship’s
company. They might have been so many long-lost
sons and nephews. The Legation belonged to them
as long as they stayed in port, and he appeared to
enjoy it all as much as they did. Captain Ross, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
was representing Gaston, Williams, and Wigmore
of New York, was ready with help, advice, and hospitality,
and as a host and friend the <em>Corsair</em> found
him true blue. The American Consul-General,
Mr. W. L. Lowrie, was also most courteous and
friendly and took particular pains to make these
American exiles feel at home.</p>

<p>In letters written home by one of the petty officers,
you may read between the lines and conclude
that there might have been worse fates than to be
marooned in Lisbon for seven weeks:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>December 24th.</em> You cannot imagine what a sensation
it is to find yourself all of a sudden walking down fine,
broad streets with rows of palm trees, and geraniums
and other flowers in bloom. The leaves are falling now
and the rainy season is beginning, but as they have
had no rain in five months we ought not to complain.
There are many picturesque street scenes, flocks of
turkeys driven by small boys with long sticks, and if
you want a turkey you halt the procession and pick
out your bird and carry it home under your arm; little
donkeys almost smothered in vegetables are led
gingerly along;—everywhere women are selling fish
which are carried in baskets upon their heads. Lottery
tickets are shoved at you from every corner. A crowd
gathers wherever we American sailors stop or loiter,
and we are great curiosities. At the best hotel, the
Avenida Palace, several of us ran into a bazaar for the
benefit of the French and Portuguese war widows and
orphans. The American Minister, Colonel Birch, a
fine old boy, introduced us to all the girls, English,
French, and Portuguese. There were some beauties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>among them, and although it is a long time since I
talked to a girl I sailed right in and had no trouble.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>I also met the French and Chinese Ministers and
talked to them. I get along in French now and carry a
conversation with ease. One of the most attractive girls
was the daughter of the chief of the British Military
Mission, Lieutenant-General Barnardiston, a soldier
and gentleman of the finest type. He commanded the
British forces which operated with the Japanese at
Kaio Chao. Yesterday I saw them after church and
met the mother who is an American. She asked us to
tea. Four of us went and stayed two hours. The General
was tremendously interesting, of course, but he
would have been more so if one of our men had not
tried to talk him to death.</p>

<p>To-morrow being Christmas, we are trimming the
ship with greens and flags and have hoisted a Christmas
tree clear to the top of the foremast. Mr. J. P.
Morgan, the owner, is very kindly blowing us off to a
dinner by cable, and we are looking forward to the
occasion. It is the first Christmas away from home and
I know how you’ll miss us all, but it should be very
joyous because we passed through that hurricane in
safety. We have a fine large cat as a mascot and as one
of the men said, “Tommy used up eight of his nine
lives in the big blow.”</p>

<p><em>January 2nd.</em> Our gaieties continue and we are
having the best time since leaving New York. Colonel
Birch gave us a reception at the Legation to meet the
diplomatic corps. The officers and fifteen men went
from this ship. All nationalities were there, from Brazil,
Uruguay, Belgium, Spain, and of course Portuguese,
French, and English. It was great fun to meet them,
and most of the diplomatic people could talk to us in
English. We had some dancing, the first I had done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
since February, and everybody was in the finest possible
spirits. The girls were stunning. The Spanish
Minister is a delightful man and has spent a lot of
time in Mexico and the United States. Our host, the
genial American Minister, resembles former President
Taft in size and quality and seemed to be having the
time of his life.</p>

<p>New Year’s Eve we were all on board ship and celebrated
it in combination with a French destroyer
which lay alongside us. At the stroke of midnight we
banged out eight bells for the old year and eight more
for the new, and then both ships opened up their whistles
and we startled the Portuguese with the pandemonium.
The Frenchies had a terrific siren. After
this outburst we sang the “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marseillaise</i>” together and
the effect was stirring. Then we sang the “Star-Spangled
Banner,” and the Portuguese sailors who had
come aboard from the Navy Yard sang their national
anthem and everybody cheered everybody else, and it
was a grand old time.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Day I went sight-seeing with a buddy
from the ship and visited several cathedrals. In one of
them all their dead kings are tucked away, and they
lift the lid off so you can look right down at the relics
of royalty. As they have been dead for hundreds of
years they are none too attractive. We had a fine dinner
on board ship in the middle of the day, turkey,
mince pie, etc., and another in the evening at the hotel.
It is mighty pleasant to have all these distinguished
people so polite to us and we also appreciate the attitude
and the courtesy of the officers of the <em>Corsair</em>.</p>

<p><em>January 9th.</em> Last evening six of us called on those
delightful English people, the Barnardistons. The
Spanish Minister and his two daughters were there.
The General played the piano for us and is very musical.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Miss Barnardiston played beautifully and the
Spanish young ladies also performed. We were represented
at the piano by Tibbott who upheld the honor
of the <em>Corsair</em>. You ought to see the row of decorations
on General Barnardiston’s coat—Victorian Order,
Rising Sun of Japan, African Campaign, and so on.
Yesterday afternoon we went to tea at the Girards,
the French people. The night before we were invited
to amateur theatricals at the British Club, given to
entertain the <em>Corsair</em> and the <em>Preston</em> and the French
destroyer. It was very cleverly done. The actors were
Portuguese and the girls were very pretty. They sang,
in English, lots of American songs. Between acts they
served cake and tea and afterwards we sang the national
airs. I was fussed to death to have to get up on
the stage and lead the whole outfit in the “Star-Spangled
Banner,” giving the key, etc., but our captain
made me do it. Our jolly American Minister,
Colonel Birch, gave me a wink which made me feel
more comfortable.</p>

<p>I went to the English church last Sunday and they
had a special service, appointed by the King, to pray
for Allied victory, and it was fine. The English always
pray for the sailors and soldiers—sailors first. They
certainly are devoted to their Navy. After church another
man and I went over to the Legation with
Colonel Birch and sat around in his biggest armchairs
for an hour. He treats us like princes and we can’t say
too much in appreciation of all he is doing for us. He
is to give us another party next Saturday and we are
looking forward to it, for he has promised to have all
the charming Portuguese girls there. We are lucky
young sea-dogs to have tumbled into all this, and we
are having the time of our lives. I was made quartermaster,
first class, the other day, and am naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
very much pleased. I shall be glad to get back and finish
my examinations for a commission, but since the
hurricane little things like that don’t bother me very
much. We have not forgotten the storm and still talk
about it—all the acts of courage and the many close
shaves.</p>

<p><em>January 14th.</em> Last night there was another dramatic
performance by the Portuguese young people, so that
the whole ship’s company could see the show. This
time I sat with the pretty French girls and it seemed
almost like New York. I dropped in to call in the afternoon.
We sat in front of a log fire and it was cozy and
homelike. Their father, M. Girard, was French Minister
to Haiti for two years, during a revolution down
there, and had some very unpleasant experiences. The
Haitian President was dragged from the Legation and
butchered before their eyes, and other acts of savagery
committed, but our marines and bluejackets landed
soon after and promptly had the situation well in hand.</p>
</div>

<p>Ensign Schanze enjoyed himself as much as the
rest of them and described the hospitality of Lisbon
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here we are, still in Portugal, where we have been
undergoing extensive repairs and entertainments.
Never in all my experience away from home have I
come across people who were as strenuously cordial as
our hosts of the city of Lisbon. There are two leading
social elements, the native Portuguese and the foreign
colony. Both have gone the limit to make us welcome
and the result has been that we have never had less
than two engagements a day, most of the time three.</p>

<p>The usual routine runs about like this—in the
forenoon some Portuguese, French, or British officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
blows on board to take us in charge to see the points
of interest; in the afternoon there is a tea to attend at
some one of the various homes or legations; and in the
evening there is a dinner party followed by a theatre
party or its equivalent. These things do not simply
occur frequently. They are daily in their rotation.</p>

<p>We, on our behalf, make our best effort to counter
with teas on board the ship; also lunch parties and
dinners whenever we can wedge them in crosswise.
Functions have become so numerous that the captain
has found it necessary to detail certain officers to attend
certain festivals daily. There have not been
enough of us to go around, even at that. This is the
first war that ever made me keep such late hours.</p>
</div>

<p>It should not be inferred that life was an incessant
round of parties, teas, and receptions for all
hands of the <em>Corsair</em> while at Lisbon. Many of the
young men had other inclinations and fought shy
of “the society stuff.” The city itself was fascinating
to those who liked to wander and explore with
their eyes open. In groups they loitered through
the dark and narrow streets of the ancient quarter
of the Alhama or enjoyed the noble prospect of
fine buildings and open spaces along the Tagus, or
strolled with the colorful crowds in the Praca do
Commercio and investigated the luxurious shops
and cafés of the Rua Augusta and the Rua da
Prata. Automobiles could be hired, and parties of
bluejackets might have been seen in the royal palaces,
the storied old churches, and the monastery
whose walls were built in 1499, on the spot where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
another sailor, Vasco da Gama, had embarked on
a famous voyage two years earlier.</p>

<p>The water-front of every large seaport is notorious
for low-browed rascals who look at Jack ashore
as easy prey, and it was not in the least to the discredit
of the hospitality of Lisbon that a pair of
<em>Corsair</em> men should have run afoul of one of these
land-sharks when they first hit the beach. The business-like
manner in which the youthful seafarers
handled the matter discouraged further attempts
to molest them. One of the pair mentioned it in his
diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Got shore liberty and landed in jail one hour later.
The way it happened was that the driver of the car we
had chartered tried to rob us and we refused to stand
for it, so he had us pinched. We explained the case in
French to a generalissimo and he turned us loose at
once and said we were dead right. He would see that
it didn’t happen again. The tough driver was laying
for us when we walked back to the ship and he tried to
get me with a knife and a machinist’s hammer. Dave
stopped him, and I got a big club and we organized to
clean up, but a crowd gathered, so we decided to quit
and go on our way as a bunch of sailors from the <em>Corsair</em>
and <em>Preston</em> hove in sight and were all set to make a
battle royal of it. I knew this would get us into serious
trouble, although I did hate to let that auto bandit get
away with it, so we withdrew in good order.</p>

<p>Yeoman Connolly improved the opportunity to
see the sights of Lisbon and some of his impressions
ran like this:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The city is the finest I have seen in Europe, barring
Paris only. The public buildings are works of art and
you see splendid architecture everywhere. The street
cars are the most modern I have seen since leaving
home, but why shouldn’t they be? I was sitting in a
car the other night and happened to look around at the
advertisements when I alighted on the builder’s name,
“John Stephenson, Elizabeth, N.J.” It made me homesick
to see the familiar name. I didn’t hesitate to tell
some of the Portuguese sitting alongside me that
Elizabeth was my home town, and they seemed very
much interested.</p>

<p>I was taken through one fine building yesterday by
a very distinguished-looking gentleman, elderly and
good-natured, who showed a lot of interest in me and
who introduced me to the Lord Mayor of the place
and to some of the Cabinet members. He himself is a
member of the Cabinet and one of the best-known men
in Portugal, I later learned. I walked through some of
the streets with him and his gold-headed cane, and
almost everybody bowed to him or looked at him with
awe. He understood English very well and told me a
whole lot of the history of the country. As a plain
American gob I got all I deserved, and then some.</p>

<p>This is a great old town. I suppose you have heard
of the revolution that is going on here. We came just in
time to see the skirmishes that are featured daily. A
funny thing occurred last night. We were loafing along
one of the main avenues when we came to a big bulletin
in front of a newspaper office. About a thousand
people were gathered in front of it and reading a notice.
To catch your eye there was printed a huge hand holding
a dagger dripping with blood, and beneath it the
announcement of another episode of the revolution
which was scheduled to take place on the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
Saturday afternoon. Some class to this burg. They are
not satisfied with trouble as it comes along, but even
advertise it in advance.</p>

<p>We are all going uptown to see a bull-fight on Sunday.
They have them two afternoons a week, but we
have picked Sunday as we want to take in part two of
the revolution as duly announced for to-morrow. In
spite of the political rough-house the city is really
wonderful and we are very lucky to be laid up here,
even if we do miss out on a few weeks of the war. The
only thing that gets me is how the deuce to talk this
Portuguese lingo. We were all learning French very
rapidly and can get along O.K. in that language, but
the stuff these people patter is simply terrible to make
out. Here we have to turn to and learn a third language,
and by the time we return to God’s country we
ought to be linguists of note.</p>

<p>The money here is very different from France. It is
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reis</i>, not the franc, that demands your careful
attention. It takes sixteen hundred reis to make an
American dollar, and when you get change for ten
dollars or so, you get a basketful of junk that looks like
so many United Cigar Store coupons. It costs about a
million reis to buy a good meal, but the food is excellent
and we get real honest-to-goodness hot rolls, just
like back home, but about as big as a football. I
brought a dozen back to the batteau last night and
when I came to pay for them I handed the gink about
seventeen hundred thousand reis, more or less. It
makes you swell up and feel richer than Rockefeller to
be handing out fortunes in this careless way, and it’s
lucky for us, as the ship has not been paid off in the
Lord knows when and most of us are flat broke. However,
the moving-picture theatres are good and fairly
cheap, and Charlie Chaplin is here, and we are allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
to stay ashore until eleven-thirty at night, which is a
long liberty for a foreign port.</p>
</div>

<p>It was difficult for the officers of the <em>Corsair</em> to
maintain the customary round of duty and discipline
while the ship was under repair, with a crowd
of Portuguese artisans aboard, many distractions
ashore, and things more or less upset, but they succeeded
in enforcing the high standards of the
United States Navy aboard. No more gratifying
evidence of this could be desired than the following
letter from the Secretary of the Navy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">

<em>March 11th, 1918</em></p>

</p>

<p>The Department is much gratified to receive through
the State Department an excellent report of the
behavior of the men of the <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Preston</em> during
their stay in Lisbon. The following is an extract from
the letter of the American Minister:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am sure that the Department will be pleased to know, as
well, that all the men behaved splendidly and made a very creditable
impression in Lisbon. It is needless for me to say that I
was very much gratified by it all and personally felt that our
men were worthy of the cordial attention and generous hospitality
bestowed upon them by the Portuguese people and others.</p>
</div>

<p>This evidence of good discipline reflects credit alike on
the officers and men of the ships and on the Naval Service.</p>

<p>To be caught in the midst of a Portuguese revolution
caused the crew of the <em>Corsair</em> more amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
than alarm, and the only regret was that they
could find no lawful excuse for taking a hand in the
shindy. It was largely a local affair, between the
military and naval forces of the Provisional Government,
and Lisbon seemed less disturbed about it
than if the street railways had gone on strike. The
shooting and commotion were mostly confined to
the water-front, and the experience of Quartermaster
Bayne, for example, would indicate that the
American sailors really enjoyed it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>January 1st.</em> It was my day’s duty on board, so
could not go to the party at the American Legation.
Everybody said it was a bully good game. We created
a large disturbance last night. When we blew our siren
to welcome the New Year, it brought the entire town
out all standing, as they thought it was the signal for
another revolution. The Portuguese troops were ordered
out and started to march at the double-quick to
the Navy Yard, as they took it for granted that the
Navy had touched off an uprising. The situation might
have been serious, but some general or other found
out that it was us and what we were doing, and the
soldiers were ordered back to the barracks. The Lisbon
newspapers gave us a write-up, and we ran true to form
as the gallant but quite unexpected and unaccountable
Americans.</p>

<p><em>January 4th.</em> This has been an exciting day. I went
ashore at two in the afternoon and was to meet the
rest of the crowd for dinner at seven. They did not
show up, and I learned later that the harbor was so
rough that the ships had to shove off and anchor in
mid-stream for a while, and no boats could come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
ashore. I spent the evening at General Barnardiston’s
and then started to foot it back to the ship. The gates
of the Navy Yard were locked, but the Portuguese
guard let me pass through. As I wandered along to the
wharf, I noticed that all lights were out in the buildings,
but I didn’t think much about it, although several
squads of soldiers looked me over pretty carefully.</p>

<p>When I got back aboard the <em>Corsair</em>, I saw that our
guns were manned, and I was greeted with, “Thank
God, you got through. How did you do it?” I asked
what was up, and got this story. The Army and Navy
were pulling off another revolution. Fighting had been
going on between the War Ministry and the Naval
Ministry buildings. Our ship was close to both. One of
our coxswains, Lindeburg, was in a motor-boat at the
foot of the Army Building and as he left the boat and
started to beat it for the ship, he was fired at while
running along the wharf. He ducked back to his boat,
and the <em>Corsair</em>, getting uneasy about him, ordered a
rescue party away. They were shot at, too, and had to
seek cover.</p>

<p>This was a bit too much, so the battery was loaded
and trained on the buildings, while an armed guard,
carrying the Stars and Stripes, marched to both
buildings. Meanwhile the captain had sent a radio
message to the authorities, demanding an instant
explanation and apology for firing on our men. This
second party of ours was not attacked and soon returned
with the other men. Half an hour later we received
an official apology. Knowing nothing about all
this ruction, I had walked through the Navy Building,
right between the lines, and aboard ship. Copeland
and Ashby were with me and for some reason we were
not shot at.</p>

<p>That about ended the trouble, as far as we were concerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
but it looked like business for a little while,
because if they had fired on our flag we should have
knocked their buildings over for sure. I understood
that our skipper sent them the message, “If you fire
on our flag we shall attack at once.”... During the
afternoon the wind and sea had been so high that most
of the ships in the harbor dragged their anchors and
the French destroyer next to us had to move out after
knocking a hole in our side which probably means dry-dock
again.</p>

<p><em>January 7th.</em> The revolution is still on, and we are
advised to keep off the streets, more or less, as there is
plenty of rifle-firing, and when these Portuguese get
excited they mistake our uniforms for their own Navy
and so take pot shots at us.... <em>January 8th.</em> Big
revolution to-day. The Army opened up with about a
hundred shells on the flagship <em>Vasco da Gama</em>, and it
was lots of fun. The shells passed almost over us and
we watched the scrap. The Navy didn’t shoot back.
The shrapnel was falling fast and the ships hauled
down their colors. The whole Portuguese Navy tried
to crowd aboard the <em>Corsair</em> for protection, but we
wouldn’t stand for that. There was a good deal of
machine-gun and rifle shooting uptown all day. There
was no liberty, but the captain sent for me and five
others and gave us special liberty to go to Mme.
Girard’s for tea. Had a fine time. We were warned to be
careful, as the soldiers fired at any naval uniform they
happened to see. They did not bother us, although we
passed a lot of infantry heavily armed.</p>

<p>At dinner ashore, the programme was interrupted
by a battle in front of the hotel, and almost everybody,
excepting ourselves, left the dining-room because the
bullets were popping about. We refused to budge, for
there was a corking good dinner on the table and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>Portuguese soldiers are pretty rotten shots. They
played a dirty German trick to-day. Some of their
Navy men shoved off unarmed in small boats and
tried to row ashore, but the troops opened fire on them,
not far from our ship, and killed a couple of the poor
Portuguese gobs. It made us so sore that we felt like
cutting loose on them.</p>

<p><em>January 9th.</em> No revolution to-day. The French
officers on the destroyer <em>Intrepide</em> have behaved splendidly
to us chaps. Of course, association with enlisted
men is unknown in the French service, that is, in a
social way. At first they couldn’t quite understand
how we happened to meet them at these various teas
and receptions, but after a time or two they grasped
the situation and have since put themselves out to be
agreeable to us.</p>
</div>

<p>The report of Commander Kittinger is an accurate
and interesting summary of the episodes of
this sputtering little revolutionary outbreak in
which the <em>Corsair</em> played a part during her pleasant
interlude at Lisbon. He wrote as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>About 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, January 4, 1918, the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em>,
being moored to the dock at the Naval Arsenal, desultory
small-arms firing broke out in the Naval Compound.
The firing was observed to come from the
windows of the second floor of the east wing of the
building forming the Arsenal Compound. It was reported
that the coxswain of the motor dory was in
the immediate vicinity, securing his boat for the night.
At intervals the firing was resumed, but the object
which drew the fire could not be made out from the
ship. Lieutenant Commander Porter and Ensign
Schanze, with four bluejackets, left the ship for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Arsenal offices to arrange for the safety of the coxswain.
On approaching within about fifteen feet of the door
in the centre of the north wing, firing was opened, apparently
at the <em>Corsair</em> party, from the same place,
the bullets hitting the walls and pavement near them.
The party entered the building without casualty.</p>

<p>Intermittent firing continued after this. After waiting
a reasonable time for the return or for news of the
first party, a second party led by Lieutenant McGuire
left the ship, carrying a flag. The searchlight from the
ship was used to illuminate the flag. This party was
not molested and returned with the first party and the
coxswain. It developed that the firing came from the
windows of the Colonial Office and was directed at
Portuguese bluejackets passing across the open space
from the shore end of the wharf to the main entrance.</p>

<p>About 11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a military aide of the President called
on board and presented the compliments of that official
with the usual courtesies, and inquired as to casualties,
if any, in our force. He was informed of what had
taken place and that no damage was done. A report
of the riot was made to the American Consul-General,
Mr. W. L. Lowrie, whose reply is herewith attached:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="no-indent">

<em>From American Consul-General, Lisbon,</em><br>
<em>To Commanding Officer, U.S.S. Corsair.</em><br>
</p>

<p><em>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your memo. of January
5th concerning the firing in the Arsenal Compound during the
evening of January 4th. Personal representations have been
made and I trust there will be no recurrence of the rioting,
although as you are fully aware conditions here just now are
most unsettled. I am extremely thankful that no one was hurt
during the rioting and that no damage was done.</em></p>
</div>

<p>Beginning January 3rd it was noticed that conditions
in Lisbon were unsettled politically. On that
night some rifle-firing took place in the streets between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
Portuguese sailors and soldiers on patrol duty. Shots
were exchanged nightly up to January 8th when the
counter-revolution took place. The situation briefly
is this:</p>

<p>The Portuguese Navy has been the controlling factor
in the politics of the country. The Army has been the
opponent, but has been negligible because of its ineffectiveness.
The Navy deposed the King in 1910 and set
up a Republic which has been perpetuated until the
present time, the last incumbent being President
Machado. When Portugal entered the war, the Army
was largely increased and equipped, and forces were
sent to the Western Front and to the Portuguese
African colonies. Army preparations continued in Portugal
and there is a large mobilization at present.</p>

<p>On December 5, 1917, the Army started a revolution
and succeeded in overthrowing the Government
two days later, the President being exiled on that date.
As a precautionary measure, the naval forces present
at Lisbon were disarmed. In spite of this, the Navy
prepared plans for a counter-revolution. The present
Provisional Government took steps to send the majority
of the sailors to the Portuguese African colonies
because of the serious reverses suffered by their troops
in Africa while fighting the Germans.</p>

<p>The Navy took steps to defeat this manœuvre and
on January 8, 1918, the <em>Vasco da Gama</em> (flagship)
anchored off Lisbon. At 10.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> a battery of three
field pieces at Saint George’s Castle in the middle of
the city, opened fire on the <em>Vasco da Gama</em>. The flagship
fired five shots in return and hoisted a red flag
under the ensign. The shots of the shore battery were
dispersed, but some seemed to strike the ship. Shrapnel
and projectile were fired. At 11.10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the <em>Vasco da
Gama</em> hauled down her flag and hoisted a white flag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
at the foremast and abandoned ship. A number of
shots were then fired at the destroyers <em>Douro</em> and
<em>Guardiana</em>, which also struck their colors and hoisted
white flags. The cruiser <em>Almirante Reis</em>, a transport,
and several gunboats did likewise. At 11.20 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> firing
ceased at the shore battery. Rifle fire continued in the
city streets. The Arsenal plant closed down at the beginning
of the firing and the workmen employed on
board the <em>Corsair</em> stopped about 11 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> No further
work was done by the Arsenal force that day.</p>

<p>On January 9th (the next day) the Arsenal resumed
operations as usual, and I was informed that the
trouble was over and work would continue as before.
The <em>Vasco da Gama</em>, with the <em>Guardiana</em> and <em>Douro</em>,
stood down the river on January 11th, apparently
undamaged.</p>
</div>

<p>The crew of the <em>Corsair</em> felt a personal interest
in the Provisional President, Sidonio Paes, as some
of them had sat at the table next to him in the
dining-room of the hotel and one or two of the officers
had met him at the theatre. One of the street
spectacles was a huge parade in honor of Sidonio
Paes, and a bluejacket described it as “tremendous
enthusiasm, everybody yelling to beat the
band and waving their hats, and the Portuguese
thought it was great, but it wasn’t as good a show
as when the Seventy-First Regiment came back
from the Mexican Border and marched up Fifth
Avenue.”</p>

<p>What the <em>Corsair</em> considered the big moment of
the long stay in Lisbon was when the landing party
marched off the yacht to rescue the two officers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the four men who had gone ashore to look for the
coxswain and find out what the row was all about.
The ship’s searchlight was turned and held to illuminate
the bright folds of the Stars and Stripes
while the gun crews stood ready for action, every
sight-setter, plugman, and shell-handler taut upon
his toes and blithely confident that the <em>Corsair</em>
could knock the adjacent buildings into a cocked
hat.</p>

<p>It was discovered that the first party had been
mistaken for Portuguese sailors and fired at from
a window only fifty feet distant. The bullets spattered
the doorway into which they turned, and they
proceeded upstairs to hold emphatic discourse with
an excited Portuguese naval officer and the chief of
the radio service who were earnestly telephoning to
ascertain what the ruction was and who had started
it. Coxswain Lindeburg had the largest grievance,
however, for he had been almost potted while
securing his motor-boat at the wharf, and it was
solemnly affirmed that he was combing the bullets
out of his hair after being escorted aboard by the
comrades who had sallied forth to find him.</p>

<p>It seems extraordinary that in this affair at Lisbon
the <em>Corsair</em> should have seen more actual
fighting, with rifle and shell fire, than during her
many months of active service with the American
naval forces in the Great War. And even when the
fleets in European waters, under the general direction
of Admiral Sims, had increased to four hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
ships and seventy thousand men, none of
them saw as much action as this almost bloodless
little outbreak in Portugal, as action had been
regarded in the days before the German doctrines
of submarine warfare. It goes to show how new and
vastly different were the problems which had to be
solved by the Allied navies.</p>

<p>This does not mean that American ships and
sailors went clear of danger and disaster, but almost
never was the chance offered to fight the hidden
foe. The fine destroyer, <em>Jacob Jones</em>, of the Queenstown
flotilla, was blown to pieces by a torpedo and
sixty-four officers and men died with her. The
Coast Guard vessel <em>Tampa</em> was blown up and vanished
with all hands, a crew of more than a hundred.
Many a time the naval guard of a merchant
steamer stood by their guns and were drowned
when the ship went down. These, and the yacht
<em>Alcedo</em>, and all the other brave ships which are
listed upon the American Navy’s roll of honor, were
worthy of the spirit and the traditions of John Paul
Jones, although to them was denied the privilege
of signalling the enemy, “We have not begun to
fight.”</p>

<p>The badly damaged <em>Corsair</em> required a long and
costly overhauling to make her ready and fit for
service, and this work was undertaken, and well
done, by the organization of the Portuguese naval
docks and arsenal. With a most admirable spirit of
friendship and coöperation between two allies in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>the struggle against a mutual enemy, the Government
of Portugal refused to accept any payment
whatever, although every effort was made to obtain
a bill for services rendered. Commander Kittinger
explains this handsome incident in the following
report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> arrived at Lisbon, Portugal, on
December 19, 1917, in need of repairs to make her
seaworthy. The matter was taken up with the Portuguese
naval authorities by the American Consul-General
and the Commanding Officer. An engineer and
a naval constructor were immediately sent off to the
ship from the Naval Arsenal to estimate and report.
The same day the Director of the Arsenal stated that
he could and would do the work, and that the ship
would be berthed at the Arsenal on the following day.</p>

<p>As promised, the Arsenal workmen came on board
and started the work, and in the afternoon the ship
was moored to the Arsenal dock. An estimate of time
and cost was requested. The time was estimated at
from one month to six weeks, but the cost estimate
could not be given. It was suggested that the cost be
made actual for labor and material, plus a reasonable
overhead. To this the Director replied that the Minister
of Marine had ordered the work done free of
charge to the U.S. Government, stating that repairs
had been done to British and French Government
vessels gratis.</p>

<p>The work proceeded rapidly and efficiently. I made
periodical calls at the office of the Chief Engineer and
Naval Constructor to obtain a cost estimate. This was
promised for my information, but never received.
Finally I was told that if the Consul-General would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
write a letter on the subject to the Minister of Marine,
the estimate would be given and a basis of payment
arranged, but that the money would be turned over
to the Red Cross.</p>

<p>The reply to the Consul-General’s letter is herewith
attached, the substance of which is a refusal on the part
of the Portuguese Government to accept payment.</p>

<p>I requested the Consul-General to keep at the business
of trying to obtain a basis of settlement. Later on,
I was informed through the Consulate that the Provisional
President, to whom the Minister of Marine
had referred the matter, had decided to accept payment.
This was the status of the question until January
25th, the day before the <em>Corsair’s</em> departure, when the
Commanding Officer, accompanied by the Consul-General,
made leave-taking calls upon the Arsenal
officials.</p>

<p>The Director of the Arsenal at this time stated that
he had orders from the President to render no bill to
the U.S. Government. As our Government had not
recognized the officials in power in Portugal during
this time, the American Minister could take no action.</p>

<p>The cost of repairs to the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> by the Portuguese
Government during the period from December
20th to January 25th is a gift to the U.S. Government.</p>
</div>

<p>A translation of the letter in which the naval
authorities of Lisbon, with the most courteous
obstinacy, decline to permit the <em>Corsair</em> to pay for
the valuable services received, reads as follows:</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Ready</span> again to tussle with the wintry seas
offshore, the <em>Corsair</em> sailed from Lisbon on
January 26, 1918, and returned to her base at Brest
at the usual cruising speed of fourteen knots. There
were many pleasant memories of the smiling, gracious
city on the Tagus, and a few broken hearts
which were soon mended among the Yankee mariners
who had sterner business and were anxious
to get on with the war. They found a greatly increased
activity at Brest, where the largest transports
were pouring the troops ashore in swelling
volume and thousands of negro stevedores emptied
the holds of supplies which overflowed the wharves
and the warehouses. The bold prediction of an
American bridge of ships across the Atlantic was
rapidly becoming a reality and the German confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
in ruthless submarine warfare was an empty
boast, thanks to the skill and courage of the Allied
naval forces.</p>

<p>In one of the American yachts, as a seaman, was
Joseph Husband, a trained writer who portrayed
the swift expansion of activity in such words as
these:<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The flag has come into its own again. In the bright
sunshine almost a hundred ships swing slowly at their
anchor chains, a vast floating island of steel hulls,
forested with slim, sparless masts and faintly smoking
stacks. Our anchor is lifted and the chain rumbles up
through the hawse-pipe. Slowly we steam past a wide
mile of vessels to our position.</p>

<p>Here are the flags of the nations of the world, but
by far the most numerous are the Stars and Stripes.
The red flag of the English merchantman is much in
evidence, and so are the crosses of Denmark, Sweden,
and Norway, and the Tri-Color of France. From a big
freighter flies the single star of Cuba. The red sun of
Japan and the green and yellow ensign of Brazil snap
smartly in the breeze. A few of the freighters are
painted a leaden gray, but for the most part they are
gay with camouflage. The spattered effects of the
earlier days are now replaced by broad bands of flat
colors. Black, white, blue, and gray are the favorites,
slanting to the bow or stern and carried across life-rafts,
boats, superstructures, and funnels. Some appear
to be sinking by the head, others at a distance seem to
be several vessels. It is a fancy dress carnival, a kaleidoscope
of color. One and all they are of heavy and ugly
lines. On forward and after decks the masts seem designed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
only to lift the cargo booms and spread the
wireless. The oil-burners are even more unshiplike, for
a single small funnel is substituted for the balanced
stacks of coal-burning steamers.</p>

<p>Fore and aft on the gun-decks the long tubes of the
guns point out over bow and stern. Yankee gun crews,
baggy blue trousers slapping in the breeze, stand beside
them and watch us pass. Blue-clad officers peer
down at us from the bridges. Aloft, hoists of gay signal
flags, red, yellow, white, and blue, flutter like confetti
in the air. From signal bridges bluejackets are sending
semaphore signals with red and yellow flags. A big
American ocean-going tug churns through the fleet.
On our right is a French mine-layer, long rows of mines
along her deck. Fast motor-boats slide in and out
among the vessels. Above, like dragonflies, three seaplanes
soar.</p>

<p>The outward-bound convoy of empty freighters is
ready. Bursts of steam from bows indicate that anchor
engines are lifting the big mud-hooks from the harbor’s
floor. One by one the ships steam slowly out of port;
converted yachts and small French destroyers on either
side. Out where the entrance broadens to the open sea,
a big kite balloon tugs at the small steamer far beneath
it and seems to drag it by a slender cord of steel.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE HOME OF THE AMERICAN NAVAL OFFICERS’ CLUB IN BREST</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Instead of a few American naval officers ashore
in Brest, there were scores of them from transports,
supply ships, and the escort divisions. Their social
headquarters, which had become almost indispensable,
was the spacious building of the American
Naval Officers’ Club on the Place du Château, conveniently
near the water-front. The club had been
organized in September, 1917, by a group of naval
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>officers among whom Lieutenant Robert E. Tod, of
the <em>Corsair</em>, was the most active in promoting its interests
and making it successful. Captain Fletcher,
later a rear admiral, was the first president and was
succeeded by Admiral Wilson when he arrived in
November. Lieutenant Milton Andrews served as
secretary, and a board of directors administered the
affairs of the club whose membership was strictly
naval.</p>

<p>The comfortable French mansion was well furnished
and equipped, with a restaurant, reading-room,
billiard-room, and bedrooms, and during
1918 there were more than six hundred members
who enjoyed this haven when they came in weary
of the sea. The name was changed to the Naval
Officers’ Mess, as more appropriate. The club-house
had been purchased by Lieutenant Tod personally,
in order to facilitate matters, and when the war was
over and the naval fleet was homeward bound, he
presented the building to the French Government
as a permanent club for the officers of the Allied
naval services. All members of the Naval Officers’
Mess were to retain their connection in this new
organization which is called “The Cercle Naval.”</p>

<p>Here the officers of the <em>Corsair</em> foregathered when
they returned from Lisbon, to catch up with the
gossip of their trade. They found the club filled
with new members and visitors, the Regular Navy
enjoying reunions and swapping yarns of bygone
cruises on the China station or in the Mediterranean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
or of service in the Spanish War when these
sedate captains and rear admirals had been flighty
youngsters or consequential two-stripers. The captain
of a huge transport fetching in ten thousand
doughboys sat in a corner with the skipper of a
little “fish boat” from Gloucester which was
trawling for German mines in the channels of the
Gironde or the Loire. The officers of the Reserve
Force met college chums or formed new friendships
and compared notes on the ways and means of
scuppering Fritz.</p>

<p>Admiral Wilson had perceived that with more
escort vessels at his command and an increasing
force promised, he could gain efficiency by distributing
his ships at several bases along the French
coast, from Brest to Bordeaux, under district commanders.
This would enable him to give better protection
and to move the convoys more rapidly as
they went in and out of the other ports of American
entry. In accordance with this plan, the <em>Corsair</em>
was detached from the Brest force and ordered to
make her headquarters on the river Gironde below
Bordeaux. The area was in the patrol district of
Rochefort which was in charge of Captain Newton
A. McCully, U.S.N., who was later made a rear
admiral. The <em>Corsair</em> found it highly satisfactory
to operate under this capable and energetic officer
who made two cruises in the yacht, in March, when
she went out to meet laden troop convoys and
escorted them in to France. The coöperating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
French naval force was directed from the station
ship <em>Marthe Solange</em> which was anchored at Verdon
on the Gironde.</p>

<p>After coaling ship at Brest, the <em>Corsair</em> started
for her new base on January 31st, escorting several
supply ships which were bound for Bordeaux and
loaded with aeroplane equipment and munitions.
How rumor flew about and was eagerly, solemnly
discussed is indicated in these bits from a sailor’s
diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>January 31st.</em> Hauled out of Brest with our convoy
at three in the morning, proceeding at nine knots. At
Quiberon we picked up the rest of them and headed for
Bordeaux, the destroyers <em>Warrington</em> and <em>Monaghan</em>
with us. I understand that we are not to go all the way
up to Bordeaux, but will base at our own Navy aviation
camp some thirty miles down the river. Hear they
will work us to death. Hope we will have a chance to
run up and see the city.</p>

<p><em>February 1st.</em> Steamed up the river and stopped at
aviation camp at Pauillac. Incidentally there are a
thousand sailors here and not one flying machine.
About five hundred Austrian prisoners and six hundred
Germans are helping build the camp. Got Bordeaux
liberty and arrived there after dark. The city is under
military law and there are all sorts of fussy Army rules
and regulations. We went to fourteen hotels before we
found a place to sleep. We couldn’t see the town, as it
was in darkness. Everybody has to be off the streets
at 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> The only criticism I have to make of the
town is that there are altogether too many soldiers
in it.</p>

<p><em>February 4th.</em> Got another liberty to-day. Heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
some big news. The <em>America</em>, on her way over here and
loaded with troops, was torpedoed. She was not seriously
damaged and by dropping depth mines brought
the German submarine to the surface. The officers and
crew were captured alive and have been carried into
Brest, along with the submarine. Also, a few days ago
a U-boat came up and surrendered to the <em>Dixie</em>, the
crew having killed the captain. The submarine was
absolutely out of provisions and supplies and the men
were in bad shape. This is a fine omen. (<em>Note:—I later
discovered that these stories are untrue.</em>)</p>

<p><em>February 6th.</em> More big news. A German submarine
came into Brest harbor flying a white flag, and surrendered.
We have her at a mooring buoy all intact and
fit for sea. They had run out of fuel oil and grub and
were fed up with the service. There wasn’t a chance
of getting back to Germany with the boat, so she sensibly
gave herself up. I hope they are all in the same
rotten bad shape. (<em>Note:—This story of the submarine
surrendering at Brest is found to be all bunk.</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>The yachts <em>Wakiva</em> and <em>May</em> now joined the <em>Corsair</em>
for escort duty and the <em>Aphrodite</em> and <em>Nokomis</em>
were added to the division force a little later. In
addition to the orders received from the American
commander of the naval district, the most explicit
instructions came from the French senior officer of
the “Division des Patrouille de Gascogne.” With
the courtesy to be expected of him, he sent also
a translation in order to save trouble for his comrades
of the American Navy. At times the English
phrasing had a Gallic twist, not enough to perplex
the <em>Corsair</em> whose officers had become adepts at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
the French nautical lingo, but the effect was a trifle
confusing to the eye of a layman, as for instance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Signals between convoy and escort are to be done
by the besides code. Do signals only if necessary. The
last ship in each line don’t show any stern lights be
ready to show navigation lights if necessary.</p>

<p>Zigzags are to be done according to the orders of the
escort’s do (see diagramms besides). All the ships show
the flag K. Manœuvring is to be executed only when
the K is getting down all the ships do K, is to be taken
like the origin of the diagramm, which is to be sailed
by the beginning. Manœuvre when the signal gets
down or when the least stations according to the regular
numerotage.</p>

<p>By fog, and on order of the escort if necessary by
WT, each column will steer like a special line each
behind the escort ships on the same side. The right line
will then steer ten degrees right hand and the left line
five degrees left hand from the primitive curse of the
convoy.</p>

<p>Escort and convoy ships are ordered not to bring
anything overboard. Burn all you can and if impossible
to burn, bring overboard rubbish altogether at once
in the beginning of night. All the rubbish spread over
the sea are precious indice for the submarine to know
the curse of the convoy.</p>
</div>

<p>During the rest of the winter and through the
spring of 1918, the <em>Corsair</em> was with the convoys
and continued to base in the Gironde. The work
seemed humdrum and monotonous to the crews,
who pined for excitement and encounters, but this
very fact was proof that the Navy was achieving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the result expected of it, which was to keep the road
open to France. Submarines ran amuck now and
then and strafed a coastwise convoy of slow ships
or sank an empty transport homeward bound, but
never for a moment was the prodigious movement
of troops and material interfered with or delayed.
Grouping the steamers together and screening them
with escort vessels, as far as possible, had baffled the
high hopes of Von Tirpitz and his murderous gang.</p>

<p>The captains of these ships which moved deep-laden
through the war zone were learning the tricks
of the trade and intelligently adapting themselves
to the exactions of the convoy system. Admiral
Sims said of them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The advantages of the convoy were so apparent to
me that, despite the pessimistic attitude of the merchant
captains, there were a number of officers in the
British navy who kept insisting that it should be tried.
In the discussion I took my stand emphatically on the
side of this school. From the beginning I had believed
in this method for combating the U-boat warfare.
Certain early experiences had led me to believe that
the merchant captains were wrong in underestimating
the quality of their own seamanship. These intelligent
and hardy men did not know what splendid ship
handlers they were. In my discussions with them they
had disclosed an exaggerated idea of the seamanly
ability of naval officers in manœuvring their large
fleets. They attributed this to the superior training
of the men and the special qualities of the ships. “Naval
vessels are built so they can keep station and turn at
any angle at a moment’s notice,” they would say, “but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>we have no men in our ships who can do such things.”
They particularly rejected the idea that when in formation
they could manœuvre their ships in fog or at
night without lights. They believed they would lose
more ships through collision than the submarines could
sink.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="p2061_ill" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/p2061_ill.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">AMERICAN YACHTS CLUSTERED INSIDE THE BREAKWATER, BREST</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>As a matter of fact, these men were entirely wrong
and I knew it. Their practical experience in handling
ships of all sizes, shapes, and speeds under a great
variety of conditions is in reality much more extensive
than naval officers could possibly enjoy. I was sure
that they could quickly pick up steaming and turning
in formation under the direction of naval officers, the
convoy commander being always a naval officer. Indeed,
one of my experienced destroyer commanders
reported afterwards that while he was escorting a convoy
of twenty-eight ships of different sizes, shapes,
speeds, nationalities, and manœuvring qualities, they
kept their stations quite as well as battleships. This
ability was displayed when the convoy executed two
fleet evolutions in order to avoid a submarine.</p>
</div>

<p>This well-earned tribute to the master mariners
who risked their lives and their ships, voyage after
voyage, finds confirmation in the records of the
<em>Corsair</em>. During the first cruise of February one
finds such entries as these:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At 11.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> ran into a thick fog. During the mid
watch (February 11th) the <em>Munindies</em> increased speed
and came up close under the stern of the <em>Corsair</em>.
Later on she passed and at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> was about 700 yards
on port bow of <em>Corsair</em>. At daylight the fog lifted and
all ships were in sight but somewhat scattered. Convoy
reformed in good order and began to zigzag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>On the night of February 12th, about 1.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
sighted two boats on the port quarter, distance 1000
yards. Boats made signals with rockets and flash
lamps. About this time the escort vessel <em>Wakiva</em>
opened fire, the shells falling about 600 yards astern of
the <em>Corsair</em>. Signalled to <em>Wakiva</em> that she was firing at
survivors and ordered her to pick them up. The convoy
stampeded, assuming a submarine attack, and was
reformed in good order about 3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Running through fog and darkness, again startled
by the sound of guns, the steamers of this convoy
“reformed in good order” and steadily, pluckily
held on their blindfolded course. Only a sailor
could realize the immense difficulties of the job and
how well it was carried on by the plodding merchantmen
who won no glory. The convoys were
growing larger and more complex to handle as the
success of the system was demonstrated. Where
the <em>Corsair</em> had escorted two or three steamers in
a group, fifteen or twenty were now sent out together.
Her next tour of sea duty in February was
a fair sample of the work which was to continue
through many wearisome weeks, with little more
diversion than a variety of uncomfortable weather.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In obedience to radio orders [runs the report] the
U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> anchored at Verdon 11.45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, February
16th. Upon arrival found the U.S.S. <em>Aphrodite</em>,
U.S.S. <em>May</em>, and French sloop <em>Regulus</em> for the same
duty. On the morning of February 17th was informed
that the convoy would be delayed one day on account
of the non-arrival of some of the ships. At 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> commanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
officers of convoy and escort present reported
aboard the French station ship <em>Marthe Solange</em> for
orders and conference with the commanding officer
of the Sixth Patrol Squadron of the French Navy.
The additional escort, the French destroyer <em>Aventurier</em>,
arrived during the conference. Orders and information
sheets were given to all concerned and explained or
discussed with the convoy captains. It was decided to
show no stern lights.</p>

<p>On February 18th the <em>Aphrodite</em> got under way, followed
by convoy vessels Numbers 1 to 6 inclusive, in
column. The <em>Regulus</em> preceded the <em>Aphrodite</em> as pilot
vessel. At 7.30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the <em>Corsair</em> got under way, followed
by convoy vessels Numbers 9-10-11-12 in column,
and when clear the <em>May</em> followed with convoy vessels
Numbers 13-14-15. Number 16, the American steamer
<em>Camaguey</em>, did not arrive to join the convoy. When
the <em>Aphrodite</em> cleared the net she proceeded at six
knots and convoy formed in double columns—ships
1-2-3-4—<em>May</em>—13-14-15 in left column, and ships
5-6-7-8—<em>Corsair</em>—9-10-11-12 in right column.
After passing the last buoy of Matelier Channel, convoy
formed in four columns and took up speed eight
knots. <em>Aphrodite</em> (chief of escort) patrolled ahead;
<em>Corsair</em> and <em>Aventurier</em> on starboard flank; <em>May</em> and
<em>Regulus</em> on port flank. A motor patrol boat escorted
until about 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> and then turned back. The sortie was
preceded by French aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Zigzagged until dark, then convoy steered base
course. Fine weather, heavy swell running from NW
which did not retard the eight knot ships.</p>

<p><em>February 19th</em>, convoy zigzagged during daylight.
Good weather for convoy operations.</p>

<p><em>February 20th</em>, steamed with convoy until 10 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>,
then dispersed as per orders. The <em>Aphrodite</em>, <em>Corsair</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
and <em>May</em> returned to Pauillac for coal and the French
escort shaped course for Brest.</p>
</div>

<p>In the search for incident during this long period
of hard work and few thrills, one must have recourse
to the letters and diaries of the <em>Corsair’s</em>
crew and pick out bits here and there. These hardy
young salts were playing the game in a fashion
something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a run one night in March (to La Pallice) after
leaving a Verdon convoy, the <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em>
ran into a pretty stiff blow. We were doing about fourteen
knots or better with the wind and sea a little on
the port bow. A good-sized sea slapped into the port
side forward, by the petty officers’ quarters, smashing
in one of the deadlights of that compartment. The
crash was tremendous. Everybody asleep down there
woke up with visions of the ship torpedoed, and out of
the hatch they boiled on the jump, mostly arrayed in
the costume which Nature provides for sailors. All
were dazed and excited. One of them no sooner hit the
deck than a wave lifted our bow and he skidded aft,
nearly half the length of the ship, on the seat of his
trousers or where his trousers should have been. It
was fortunate for that sailor that our executive officer
kept the decks smooth and well-cared-for. The outfit
couldn’t see the humor of the situation, being soaking
wet and unable to dope out what had happened.</p>

<p><em>March 4th.</em> The ship was a mad-house to-day. They
told us there would be admiral’s inspection and we
had to turn to on everything from the bilges to the
crow’s-nest. Every stitch of clothing in our boxes had
to be stowed somewhere. I was never so bored in my
life. We sat around from noon to four o’clock waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
for the blinkin’ admiral, but, of course, he never showed
up. These admiral’s inspections always give me a pain
in the eye. We have made ready several times and it’s
always a false alarm.</p>

<p><em>March 10th.</em> The <em>Aphrodite</em> spotted a floating German
mine and opened fire on it. She fired thirty-five
shots and never hit it. We turned around and sunk it
on the third shot. It did not explode, but filled with
water and went down after a hole was put through it.</p>

<p><em>April 4th.</em> Picked up our convoy consisting of the
troop-ships <em>Powhatan</em>, <em>Martha Washington</em>, and <em>El
Occidente</em>, all packed with Yankee soldiers. There are
six destroyers with the escort, including the <em>Caldwell</em>,
one of the new flush-deckers. At 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the <em>Occidente</em>
sighted a periscope. We at once started submarine
tactics, screening the convoy while the <em>Winslow</em> and
<em>Sampson</em> went back to look for the sub. They dropped
eighteen depth charges. Fritz must have been shaken
up some. He did not get a chance to shoot a torpedo,
for the destroyers were too alert.</p>

<p><em>April 5th.</em> Captain Porter left the ship, going back
to America on leave. The rumor is that he will not
return to this ship. It would certainly be a big loss to
us, as he is one fine seaman and navigator as well as a
splendid character of a man. We gave him three cheers
when he shoved off, and it seemed to touch him considerably.
He stood at salute in the boat until out of
sight.</p>

<p><em>April 6th.</em> This is the first anniversary of our entry
into the war. In consequence, all the American vessels
had to dress ship. We coaled all day and will finish
to-morrow. In again, out again, coal again, Finnegan!
The <em>Martha Washington</em> discharged her troops. They
were cavalry and nigger infantry. They were held up
for several hours and the darkies had us rocking all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
the time. They claimed they saw four submarines sunk
the other day after being attacked by eleven or nine.</p>

<p><em>April 9th.</em> I got in trouble to-day. In the storm last
night an American ship came in and anchored four
miles off. I was on signal watch and read her flag hoist
as LDBC, the <em>Rangely</em>, and reported her as such. Discovered
to-day that she was the LDQC or <em>Graster Hall</em>.
I caught all the blame. The <em>Q</em> they had up was so terribly
dirty that in the distance and bad light it could
not be taken for anything else than a <em>B</em>. There was no
alibi for me, however, and I don’t know whether the
bawling out I got will be all of it or not. It was my
mistake, an unavoidable one, but in war-time that
makes no difference in this man’s navy.</p>

<p><em>May 10th.</em> Captain Kittinger is to be transferred to
command a big transport and Commander Porter is
coming back to take this ship. I shall be glad to see
Captain Porter, but we are mighty sorry to see Skipper
“Bill” Kittinger go. The <em>Wakiva</em> dropped over one of
the new 300-pound depth bombs and pretty near blew
herself up. She busted several things in her engine-room.</p>

<p><em>May 22nd.</em> Just as we came off watch at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in a
dense fog we got an S.O.S. from our old friend, the
<em>Wakiva</em>. She was rammed and sunk by the <em>Wabash</em> of
her convoy. She went down rather deliberately and
only two men were lost. We are sorry to cross her off
the list, as she was a willing worker, although slow.
At 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we met the largest convoy of troop-ships that
has come overseas. The first group of fourteen ships
carried forty-five thousand soldiers, to say nothing of
the naval crews aboard, and there were twelve destroyers
in the escort. The second group of nine ships had
twenty-five thousand troops. It was a great sight.
They will be landed at Brest.</p>

<p><em>May 24th.</em> Hooray! We have thirty-five German prisoners
to shovel the coal from the lighters into the
buckets. And, by gosh, these square-heads went on
strike and the kindly French let ’em get away with it.
If any prisoners went on strike in Germany it’s a
cinch they’d be shot full of holes. They don’t treat ’em
rough enough in France.</p>
</div>

<p>After looking over several of these <em>Corsair</em>
diaries, Commander Kittinger had this shrewd and
good-humored comment to offer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The impressions which these youngsters jotted down
were amusing and often inaccurate, but they caught
the spirit of the service and the day’s work. When one
of them felt aggrieved because he was “bawled out,”
he never stopped to take an inventory of his professional
qualifications and the duties thrust upon him
as well as upon other untrained and unseasoned lads.
Nor did he always realize that he was allowed to perform
functions whereby he had the safety of a hundred
and twenty-five lives and a million dollars worth of
irreplaceable property between his two hands. There
was no time to learn by experience and every “bawling
out” was, I hope, driving an important fact home.
Where else could one of these boys have learned such
valuable lessons and be on a pay-roll at the same time?
Of course they could not understand such methods,
but the system soon separated the sheep from the
goats—the latter remaining at the business end of a
deck swab. Many times the skipper was not as angry
as he appeared. The first lesson was to say “Aye, Aye,
Sir,” when told something important instead of trying
to explain. When a young man explains, he is not listening
to the order, but thinking up a reply.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span></p>

<p>To the <em>Corsair’s</em> company the most interesting
happenings during the long period of convoy duty
were the changes and promotions which shifted
many of the family to other ships and stations and
brought new faces aboard. Commander Kittinger
had been advanced a grade on the Regular Navy
list since joining the <em>Corsair</em> and was in line for
transfer to a larger ship. He was given the stately
armed transport <em>Princess Matoika</em>, formerly the
<em>Princess Alice</em> of the North German Lloyd, and
thereafter carried many thousand American troops
in safety to France. In this ship the roster of officers
was more imposing than in the yacht which served
so faithfully, for Commander Kittinger now gave
orders to two lieutenant commanders, eleven lieutenants,
and twenty ensigns. Toward the <em>Corsair</em>
he felt affection and loyalty and was glad that his
war record had included a year with her, crossing
with the first American troops and battering about
in the Bay of Biscay. Drilled in the exacting school
of the regular service, he had only praise for the
spirit, intelligence, and devotion of the Reserves,
officers and men, who had fitted themselves to
circumstances and played the game to the hilt.</p>

<p>After the war Commander Kittinger was sent to
the Fore River Ship Building Company as Naval
Inspector of Ordnance. While there he received the
following letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">
<em>July</em> 23, 1919</p>
<p class="no-indent">
From:    Director of Naval Intelligence,<br>
To:      Chief of the Bureau of Navigation:<br>
Subject: Award of the Legion of Honor.<br>
</p>

<p>The Bureau is informed that by a decree of the
President of the French Republic the award of Member
of the Legion of Honor with the rank of Chevalier
has been made to Commander Theodore A. Kittinger,
U.S.N., with the following citation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Commander Kittinger, in command of the yacht Corsair,
escorted the O.V.H.N. convoys, etc.</em></p>
</div>

<p>It is requested that a copy of this letter be filed with
this officer’s record.</p>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Porter became the commander
of the <em>Corsair</em> on May 31st, and held the
position until the yacht returned home one year
later. It gratified him, of course, to have his own
ship, and in the opinion of his officers and crew the
honor was well deserved. It was a distinction also,
and without precedent in a combatant ship, for a
Reserve officer to be given a vessel of the size and
class of the <em>Corsair</em>. He was later advanced to the
naval rank of commander and finished his service
as a three-striper.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Commander Tod was detached to
join the organization of Admiral Wilson at Brest
as Port Officer and was afterwards appointed
Director of Public Works. Both positions were
important and involved varied and arduous responsibilities.
He was later promoted to the rank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
of Commander. At a dinner given by the American
naval officers of the club in Brest, this rousing song
of the Breton Patrol was rolled out with a vigor
that rattled the windows:</p>

<p class="no-indent">
1. Oh we sing of a squadron patrolling the coast<br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From Cre-Ach to old Saint-Nazaire.</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">On the job for a year, we still say with a cheer,</span><br>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The Chief of the Breton Patrol.</span><br>
<br>
2. It’s a squadron that’s doing its best over here<br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Towards keeping command of the seas;</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">For by day or by night, standing by for a fight,</span><br>

<br>
3. To the Point of Penmarch it is not very far;<br>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Some forty-five miles of blue sea,—</span><br>
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That’s where some day poor Fritz will be blown into bits</span><br>

5. If a depth charge turns over and falls in the sea,<br>

<p>Lieutenant McGuire was made executive officer
of the <em>Corsair</em> when Captain Porter took over the
command. In time of peace Lieutenant McGuire
had been first officer of the yacht, so he was really
stepping into his old berth. Ensign Schanze, the
efficient gunnery officer, had been commissioned a
lieutenant in December. In May he was transferred
from the <em>Corsair</em> to the staff of Rear Admiral
McCully, the District Commander at Rochefort.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
For some time he acted as liaison officer on board
of the French station ship <em>Marthe Solange</em>, and his
scientific training was later employed in experimenting
with and testing listening devices for detecting
enemy submarines.</p>

<p>Ensign Gray, the communications officer who
had helped to make the radio service of the <em>Corsair</em>
notable throughout the fleet, was anxious to have a
whirl at the destroyer game, like any proper-minded
young Navy man, and on May 28th he was transferred
to the <em>Monaghan</em> of the Brest flotilla.
Assistant Surgeon Laub was sent to the <em>Moccasin</em>
in April and Assistant Surgeon R. H. Hunt exchanged
billets with him for a short time, shifting
from the <em>Corsair</em> to the destroyer <em>Nicholson</em>. Chief
Engineer Hutchison stood by the ship until September,
although his health was poor and he had
been compelled to seek hospital treatment ashore.
After leave at home he regained his strength and
sailed in the big transport <em>Agamemnon</em>. His position
in the <em>Corsair</em> was filled by Lieutenant J. J.
Patterson as engineer officer. Assistant Engineer
Mason received an appointment as ensign in May
and went ashore for staff duty at Bordeaux in the
autumn. His partner in the engine-room, Assistant
Engineer Hawthorn, left the <em>Corsair</em> in June and
was assigned to the naval auxiliary service as a
senior engineer officer. Boatswain Budani, who had
polished off the aspiring bluejackets and taught
them to be regular, sea-going gobs, was summoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
to the Naval Aviation Headquarters at Paris and
later sent to Italy.</p>

<p>At the ward-room table were new officers to be
welcomed into the briny brotherhood of the <em>Corsair</em>,
Ensign A. H. Acorn, Jr., Lieutenant Gerald Nolan,
Ensign J. W. McCoy, Ensign P. F. Wangerin,
Ensign C. R. Smith, Ensign S. K. Hall, Ensign R.
V. Dolan, several of whom were promoted to be
lieutenants, junior grade. After the armistice and
while the <em>Corsair</em> was in the North Sea and at
Queenstown, there were other changes which will
be noted later.</p>

<p>Through the winter and spring the task of studying
for commissions which had bred so many headaches
in the bunk-rooms below was getting on
famously. There were gloomy moments when, as
has been said, one candidate felt sure that the captain
would recommend him for nothing else than
a firing squad, or another had believed that a
“bawling out” had utterly wrecked his prospects,
but such dark forebodings were mostly unfounded.
Examining boards of officers were duly convened,
or recommendations made for the intensive course
at Annapolis, and the <em>Corsair</em> was like a college
grinding out diplomas at Commencement time,
excepting that the Navy course was far stiffer than
the requirements of the campus. There were no
“snap courses” in the Bay of Biscay and no bluffing
the faculty.</p>

<p>The following enlisted men, with one warrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
officer, were examined, qualified, and given commissions
with the rank of ensign:</p>

<p>Chief Quartermaster F. S. Fair and Chief Commissary
Steward H. A. Barry passed the examinations
successfully, but failed on the tests for
eyesight and were thereby disqualified for commissions,
a misfortune which keenly disappointed
them and their shipmates. Commander Kittinger
volunteered this high opinion of them: “Two of
the best men we had, I regret to say, received no
rewards and it was a loss to the service. Fair and
Barry get 100 per cent from me in every department.
If they were physically fit to be bluejackets
it might seem as though they were physically fit
to be officers, but such were the regulations.”</p>

<p>Ensign Carroll Bayne stayed in the <em>Corsair</em> for a
little while as an officer and was then transferred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>to staff duty at Brest, assisting Lieutenant Commander
Tod who was Port Officer at the time. In his
diary Bayne indicated what his duties were, and
they suggest that the Naval Reserve officer was
expected to turn his hand to almost everything,
and at very short notice:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Tod took me around to-day to call on all the
French admirals, etc., and they were very courteous.
I got an awful call down from an American three-striper
for not saluting him. I started to, but he did
not see me, so I knocked off. However, he came back
and gave me particular fits.... The <em>Leviathan</em> came in
to-day with ten thousand troops. She is the most enormous
thing I ever saw. It took three hours to moor her.
She bumped a tanker coming in, almost sank the <em>Burrows</em>
destroyer, and ended by sinking a French tug. The
soldiers began coming ashore before she was moored.
That packet needs considerable elbow-room. I went
aboard the <em>Leviathan</em> at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and almost got lost in
her. In fact, I did. Her bridge is much higher than the
<em>Corsair’s</em> foretop. Weather beastly and we spent most
of the day getting coal barges to and from her....</p>

<p><em>June 25th.</em> The <em>Leviathan</em> sailed for the States. I was
out there until she left, helping to unshackle her and
get her under way. I have the night trick, so will have
to sleep in the office. This is some job.... The <em>Great
Northern</em> and <em>Northern Pacific</em> came in with troops and
will leave to-morrow night. They are certainly making
speed back and forth these days.... <em>July 1st.</em> Started
out at 6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and boarded fifteen ships. One had run
aground on a rock and her bow was smashed and the
fore-peak full of water. I made arrangements to dock
her to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p><em>July 4th.</em> Big parade to-day, but I saw none of it.
Twenty-three American transports came in and I had
to board them all, a four-hour job. We are expecting
more troop-ships to-morrow. It is up to me to get them
coaled, watered, and ready to turn around.... <em>July
11th.</em> The <em>Von Steuben</em> left to-night in a heavy storm.
Commander Tod, Major O’Neil, and I went out to
meet a convoy of thirteen ships, all carrying troops.
The Major got very sick in the rough sea. We had the
devil of a time, and no other word applies. Got back at
3 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> and had to anchor and then board all these ships
in total darkness. Another one of those ships from
the Great Lakes broke down and that means work
for me to-morrow. This is the fourth one of the kind
that has gone to pot here. I wish they could be left
at home.</p>

<p><em>July 18th.</em> Roughest day yet, seas very high. I went
over to assist in getting the <em>Leviathan</em> under way. She
started off at seventeen knots and her back-wash came
within an ace of upsetting us. Had a tough time making
landings on this batch of troop-ships. When I got
alongside the <em>Westerdyke</em> a huge wave slammed my
boat against her, carrying away all my superstructure
and chewing things up generally. We managed to get
clear and stay afloat.</p>

<p>I got in wrong with the Army who claimed I stole a
ship from them. A collier came in, and as the Navy
was badly in need of coal, I refused to look at her manifest
and sent her over to our repair ship <em>Panther</em> and
began to coal her. The Army got wise and put up a
yell, but it was too late and I got away with it. They
say that if the trick is done again they will report it
to Pershing. Let ’em go to it, as long as the Navy gets
the coal when it needs it.</p>

<p>While the <em>Corsair</em> was driving through the blustering
winds and seas of March, there came bright
days now and then which were a harbinger of
springtime in Brittany. In a letter written on
Palm Sunday, Chief Quartermaster Farr depicted
the following contrast with the grim routine of the
war by sea and land:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have had a delightful day. In the first place, the
weather is like June and now it is moonlight and a
dead calm is resting on the bay and I feel the joy of
life and the beauty of Nature. This morning I went
ashore to the Catholic church, and the entire population
of the little Breton fishing town must have been
there. Of course I couldn’t understand what was going
on, but it was restful and soothing to say your prayers
and think a little and listen to the organ. A Frenchman
with a good voice sang “Hosanna, Glory to God,” and
I prayed hard for the English armies in the great battle
which is now raging. Their losses are heavy and I think
of the terrible anxiety in England for their boys. Not
that there is any doubt of the outcome, but so many
brave men are dying, and when you read of the Ninth
Division, say, as particularly distinguishing itself,
you can imagine the feelings of the mothers of those
men.</p>

<p>This afternoon several of us walked out to a little
château built in the time of Louis XVI which was very
interesting. The old French people were extremely hospitable,
gave us tea, and showed us everything. They
had a beautiful little garden with lots of vegetables
growing, peach and cherry blossoms, wonderful hawthorn
hedges, spring flowers everywhere, the birds singing,
and the whole landscape peaceful and happy. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
was hard to realize that the greatest battle of the war
is raging in the north.</p>

<p>We walked back to the Y.M.C.A. where we each
had four fried eggs with some of the Army engineer
troops. They come from California and Oregon, and
are the best and huskiest-looking soldiers I’ve seen
yet. A darky was in the party, a Navy cook, and he was
as good as a minstrel show. He ordered six eggs, and
as soon as they came on the table he ordered another
half-dozen. He said he was honin’ and pinin’ for to get
to Dunkirk, and would probably get killed by a bomb
if he did, but “befo’ the Lawd, boss, I jes’ itches to go
anyhow. It’s mah destination, she sure is.”</p>

<p>I am mighty glad to have had this service in the
ranks. I wouldn’t have missed it for anything. It is
the only way to know the real Army and Navy.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CORSAIR STANDS BY</span></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> business gets more interesting every day and
is by far the most fascinating industry I have ever
undertaken [declared Lieutenant Schanze, in letters
written during the autumn and winter]. Of course it is
extremely strenuous, the long sea voyages into an eternally
rough ocean, the cold, wet days and nights, and
the everlasting vigil that must be kept despite wind,
rain, fog, and storm. It gets to the nerves of the boys
and a few of them show signs of weakening at times,
but on the whole, and in my humble opinion, the
<em>Corsair</em> has the most pugnacious and indefatigable
bunch of fighters in the whole Navy.</p>

<p>You see, the <em>Corsair</em> and the <em>Aphrodite</em> were the
first American war vessels to patrol the Bay of Biscay;
consequently we are old-timers here and are looked up
to by the others as being well versed in this game.
The hard service is the best thing that could have happened
to us. Being in a war without actually serving on
the firing line would drive me looney, but as things have
turned out I have the most wonderful opportunity to
exercise all my mechanical ingenuity and experience
and they have more than stood me in good stead.</p>

<p>This war work agrees with me better than anything
I have engaged in. I am growing stouter and more
vigorous and enjoying every minute of it.... If we
bean a submarine and crow about it, everybody ashore
gives us the horse laugh because we did not have the
propellers or conning tower to show for it; and if some
misguided sub takes a shot at us and the torpedo happens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
to miss and biffs one of the empty buckets we are
escorting over the horizon, the Admiral roars until we
dare not show our faces ashore. I recently heard the
anti-submarine campaign assailed on the ground that
the submarines are still at large and going strong. They
are. But the submarine campaign of Germany is away
past its zenith. It was passed several months ago and
the lid is now being nailed down on its coffin.</p>

<p>We are over here in this mess up to our ears and we
know what has taken place when the whole ocean seems
to tremble and that sickening, muffled roar, whose
direction defies discovery, comes to our ears. We know
that another torpedo has found its mark. Does it make
us gloomy? It does not. It cheers us up. Why? Because
we can instantly diagnose just how it was done and we
recognize that our enemy is becoming more timid, impotent,
and desperate. Very soon every successfully exploded
torpedo will cost the life of the sub that sent it.
Instead of being the terror of the seas that they were
last June and July, the U-boats now advertise the fact
that the terror of the seas is the American destroyer.</p>

<p>The war goes booming along on an ever greater
scale, and to those who are given this opportunity of
viewing the panorama, it unfolds itself with a magnitude
that defies all description. Could I but tell you of
the vast works that America alone has put upon the
landscapes here in France, you would believe my
enthusiasm exaggerated. Details I cannot give, but as
a comparison imagine a contract for the construction
of a series of communities, each one about as large as
Newark was ten years ago, and imagine them equipped
with every modern improvement such as wharfage on a
river-bank formerly barren, manufacturing plants for
the fabrication of everything from wooden legs to steel
ships, and then accept this as a fact already accomplished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>and doing business, and you can gather some
idea of the tremendous efforts that have been put forth.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>For all this we are indebted, not nearly so much to
the men here at the front as to those whose untiring
efforts at home, in face of all kinds of criticism of the
most venomous kind, have driven this enormous task
to a successful culmination. I have a wonderful respect
for our men at home who have had to stay home and
accomplish things which they could never disclose to
a naturally impatient and clamoring public. Had the
Germans done such things as I have seen here accomplished
by Americans, I would have taken off my hat
to them and acknowledged the fact that German
efficiency coupled with the advantages of a despotism
was at least worthy of a close look. I dwell upon this
phase of the situation because it has recently come to
my attention, from most reliable sources, that there is
a tendency toward gloom in certain quarters at home.
The constant attacks made by conscientious critics,
aside from the braying of the eternally discontented
and the insidious whispers of the disloyal, are liable to
make even the stoutest hearts falter at times.</p>

<p>I cannot too emphatically contradict every reason
advanced to sustain a gloomy attitude of mind. There
is every reason for the greatest enthusiasm and confidence.
In fact, we over here on the firing line have a
spontaneous kind of enthusiasm that comes only to
the victorious. This war is a long and ferocious process
in which each battle must be considered as a single
shot fired only as a part of the <em>ensemble</em>. On land and
sea things look better than they have in a long time.
Every American effort is pure velvet for the Allied
side. I trust our nation will now begin to see that
America is a big and powerful fellow among the nations
of the world and that, with just a little bit of careful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
attention, this European situation can be hammered
into shape. The women of the country are, after all,
pretty much the whole thing, for they can inculcate
the spirit of fight and of happy confidence that nothing
else can put into their boys. If the mother will adopt
the old Spartan admonition of “Come home either
with your shield or on it,” the boys will keep surging
into this war with an ardor that no enemy can stop.</p>

<p>... My experiences thus far have brought me more
laughs than it has been my pleasure to have in any
other period of time. I must confess, however, that
many of the laughs come when I view some of the situations
in retrospect. At times, especially in the middle
of a ruction, when literally tons of high explosives are
being launched, we are too busily engaged to laugh. On
such occasions we have to think rapidly and work fast.</p>

<p>One incident may be worthy of note. A flock of
troop-ships was under escort through the torpedo zone.
The eagle eye of a trained observer caught the tell-tale
symptoms of a submarine trying to manœuvre into
striking position. Activities began at once, if not
sooner. Those of us whose job it was to look after the
sub, did it. Those of us whose job it was to screen the
troop-ships, did that. On one of the transports were
many negroes who knew more about shore duties than
seafaring. On the ship they were passengers <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem</i>.</p>

<p>The process of dealing with a submarine certainly
must send thrills through a spectator who has never
attended any rehearsals. The negroes in question were
all novices and their chief emotion was primitive terror.
The simultaneous explosion of forty or fifty barrels of
dynamite made the whole ocean heave and rumble.
Even those of us who were used to dropping ’em over
and who were braced for the shock, felt considerably
jolted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<p>The darky soldiers thought the end of creation had
sure busted loose in epidemic form. One of them excitedly
dug down into his pack and fished out a Bible.
Opening it on deck, he knelt upon it, wrung his hands
to Heaven and cried in accents that could be heard
above the racket of the explosions, “O Lawd, O Lawd,
I’se never gwine roll dem bones no mo’. Ah promise it.
Ah promise it absotively.”</p>

<p>Another one decided that this method of imploring
grace was worth imitating in the terrible crisis, so he
rushed over and tried to get knee-room on the same
Bible. Shoving his comrade aside, he managed to find
a sacred anchorage and his supplication was, “Good
Lawd Jesus, lemme see jes’ one green tree. Ah ain’t
askin’ you to send me back home across dis yere big
ocean till th’ war is done. Ah’ll stay right where I is
put, but lemme see jes’ one green tree befo’ all dem
German su’marines gobble dis pore niggah like Jonah
an’ th’ whale.”</p>

<p>Half an hour after the excitement was over, these
devout passengers were shooting dice as busily as ever.
There were negroes in another unit which we escorted
into France. In wandering about the port, they came
across some of their own race, black troopers from the
French African colonies. Negotiations were opened to
start a conversation going, but they could find no
common language until one of the bunch produced a
pair of dice. This, it seems, instantly broke down the
barrier, and they soon had going as fine a little game of
international craps as a man ever saw. Both sides
whooped and haw-hawed until traffic was blocked and
the police interfered.</p>

<p>Industriously employed in this service with the
convoys, the <em>Corsair</em> encountered no slant of misfortune
until June. Then came the loss of the fine
cargo steamer <em>Californian</em> with holds and decks full
of several million dollars worth of supplies for the
American Army in France. This disaster was not
the result of submarine attack. The ship was unlucky
enough to bump a German mine about fifty
miles off the entrance of the Gironde River while
nearing port with the convoy and escort.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> stood by and made every possible
effort to save the precious <em>Californian</em> endeavoring
to haul her along at the end of a tow-line, but the
damage was vital and salvage hopeless. It was one
of those numerous episodes of the warfare at sea, as
waged by the enemy, which seemed so enormously
wasteful, so impossible for civilization to endure,
this senseless obliteration of property on a scale
without precedent in the whole history of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span></p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> found the convoy of eight ships in
the afternoon of June 20th and took position with
the other escort vessels, <em>Aphrodite</em>, <em>May</em>, <em>Nokomis</em>,
and two French patrol boats. They steamed toward
the coast at eleven knots without misadventure
until early in the morning of the 22d. Then the
<em>Californian</em> made a turn to the right, quitting the
formation, and slowed speed until she came to a
halt. Her crew could be seen jumping into the boats
and letting them drop from the davits. There was
no more ado about it than this, no sound of an
explosion nor any disturbance of the sea. It was an
uncanny, inexplicable thing to witness. From the
bridge of the <em>Corsair</em> it was easy to perceive that
the sailors of the <em>Californian</em> were proceeding,
earnestly and eagerly, to abandon ship. It was
done without disorder, but they were wasting no
time.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> promptly swung to go near, at the
order of Lieutenant McGuire, who was the officer
of the deck. The yacht moved to the rescue with a
speed which surprised even the <em>Californian</em>. Already
the long, deep-laden steamer was settling by
the head. One of the little French escort vessels
had also hastened to the scene, but as she rolled
in the trough of the ground swell, the sea slapped
across her deck and the first boat to pull away from
the <em>Californian</em> found so much difficulty in trying
to lay aboard that the men semaphored the <em>Corsair</em>:
“Will you please come and pick us up?” Presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the master of the big steamer and many of his crew
were scrambling up the side of the <em>Corsair</em>, where
Commander Porter strongly urged that an attempt
be made to save the <em>Californian</em>. He was ready to
tow if the water could be kept down in the flooded
compartments. It was a sporting chance, but better
than letting the ship drown before their eyes.</p>

<p>Cheered by this readiness to lend a hand, the
executive officer of the <em>Californian</em>, with sixteen
volunteers from their crew, returned on board and
a ten-inch manila hawser was passed from the <em>Corsair</em>.
Because the bow of the stricken ship had
filled so fast and was almost buried in the sea, the
hawser was made fast astern and the <em>Corsair</em> tried
to tow her wrong end to, as offering the least resistance.
The sluggish mass moved very slowly,
perhaps two knots, but it was impossible to steer
it. The plucky <em>Corsair</em> dug her toes in, as one might
say, and pulled like a thoroughbred horse harnessed
to a wagonload of stone.</p>

<p>When this first attempt proved futile, it was
decided to try towing by the bow, but while they
were dragging the hawser forward the engine-room
bulkheads collapsed with a roar and the sea rushed
in to fill the dying ship. She went down by the head,
the stern rearing higher and higher in air, until
the great hull towered in a vertical position, and
there it hung for an amazingly long time. It was
surmised that the bow had struck the bottom of
the sea. Then the stern slowly dropped and vanished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
while the crew of the <em>Corsair</em> watched and
wondered and felt very sad at heart.</p>

<p>No lives were lost; this was the redeeming feature,
and the eighty-five officers and men of the
<em>Californian</em> were all safely aboard the yacht where
they were as hospitably cared for as the crowded
quarters permitted. On the decks of the lost steamer
were hundreds of Army motor-trucks, and one of
the <em>Corsair’s</em> men, for lack of anything better to
say, was heard to murmur as the sea swallowed
them up:</p>

<p>“There’s some water in your carbureters this
trip, and that’s no foolish jest.”</p>

<p>The dog rescued from the <em>Californian</em> remained
aboard the <em>Corsair</em> as a souvenir and mascot, but
the life in the Bay of Biscay was not to his taste, in
spite of the efforts of the crew to make him feel at
home. He was therefore detached and assigned to
the U.S.S. (Auxiliary) <em>Balti</em> and sent to the United
States, but fell down a hatch at Hoboken and was
a total loss. For an epitaph, Kipling’s line seems
apt, “We’re safer at sea again.”</p>

<p>Commander Porter’s official account of the loss
of the ship reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">
<em>June 22, 1918</em></p>
<p class="no-indent">
From: Commanding Officer,<br>
To:   Commander U.S. Naval Forces in France,<br>
<span style="padding-left: 4em">Via District Commander, Rochefort.</span><br>
</p>

<p>At 4.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> observed the U.S.S. <em>Californian</em> stop,
turn to the eastward, and abandon ship. The <em>Corsair</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
immediately went about and closed on the <em>Californian</em>.
At 5.15 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> two boats from the <em>Californian</em> were alongside
and survivors came on board. I informed their
Executive Officer that we were close to land and suggested
that it might be possible to get the ship into
port. He immediately ordered his firemen into a boat
and returned to the <em>Californian</em>. The <em>Corsair</em> circled
about the ship.</p>

<p>At 7.05 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> all hands abandoned the <em>Californian</em>
and came on board the <em>Corsair</em>. The captain informed
me that he could do nothing as the engine-room was
filling with water. I told him that we would attempt
to tow. He returned to the <em>Californian</em> with a boat’s
crew, taking the end of our tow-line with him. As the
<em>Californian</em> was down by the head and we had a fair
wind, our tow-line was made fast to the stern.</p>

<p>At 7.55 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we started ahead. At 8.20 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> it was
found that we could not handle the ship by the stern;
stopped and attempted to take the line forward. Before
it could be made fast, the ship settled so rapidly that
the crew was obliged to abandon her, and we hauled
the tow-line on board. At 8.54 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the bow of the <em>Californian</em>
went down, apparently resting on bottom. At
9.04 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the stern disappeared and <em>Corsair</em> proceeded.
While waiting we hoisted two of the <em>Californian’s</em> boats
on board. During these operations one French destroyer
stood by.</p>

<p>It is believed by the Commanding Officer of the
<em>Californian</em> that the damage was caused by a mine.
Nothing was seen. No radio message was sent as antennæ
was disabled by the explosion. There were no
casualties.</p>
</div>

<p>The lost ship was commanded by Lieutenant
Commander D. Mahlman, U.S.N.R.F., and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
under charter to the United States Government.
To the Board of Inquiry convened for the purpose,
he presented his own story of the disaster,
which was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At 4.50 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> felt an explosion amidships. Stopped
the ship and ordered all hands to stand by the boats.
The Engineer Officer reported water and oil leaking
into the forward stoke hold. Sounded bilges and found
three feet in No. 1; No. 2 full; and Nos. 4 and 5 empty.
On examining the engine-room and stoke hold again,
I found the water over the floor plates, the engineers
meanwhile having the pumps working on the stoke
hold bilge. The water was steadily gaining so I ordered
the boats to be lowered and the ship abandoned.</p>

<p>Sent two boats away to the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> which
was standing by, while I remained on board with
Ensign Schwartz and boat’s crew to investigate further
if it were possible to do anything to keep the ship
afloat, the pumps being worked to the full capacity
continually. Soon afterwards two boats from the <em>Corsair</em>
returned to the ship with some of the officers and
crew.</p>

<p>Extra efforts were made by the engineer force to
gain headway on the incoming water. When the water
had risen to the fire-boxes and continued to increase,
on the report of the Chief Engineer that the water was
beyond control, I ordered all hands to abandon ship.
Having gone aboard the <em>Corsair</em>, the Commanding
Officer asked me how long I thought the ship would
keep afloat, to which I replied four or five hours. He
then suggested towing, so I returned to the ship with
my Executive Officer and sixteen men, taking a tow-line
which was made fast to the stern, the best method
of towing under the existing circumstances. No results<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
were obtainable and an attempt was made to shift the
tow-line to the bow.</p>

<p>While the tow-line was being shifted forward, from
observations made by me in the engine-room it was
evident that the ship could not stay afloat much longer
as she was then rapidly settling by the head. I again
gave orders to abandon the ship, which was done, and
the <em>Californian</em> soon began to sink rapidly, going down
bow first until the stern was almost perpendicular.
Later the ship slowly righted and the stern disappeared
entirely at 9.04 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> in Latitude 46° 17′ 15″ North,
Longitude 2° 10′ 30″ West.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> had tried and failed, which was ever
so much better than not trying at all, and as one of
her men mournfully observed, “With any sort of a
break in luck, we would have salvaged her and a
cargo that was so valuable that the Army organization
was figuring out some way of raising it during
the summer.”</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>This was the only ship lost out of a convoy with
which the <em>Corsair</em> operated during the long period
of this service in and out of the Gironde, from June
to November of 1918. On several occasions steamers
were attacked and sunk or damaged just before
joining or just after leaving the escort. These
included the <em>Montanan</em>, the <em>Westbridge</em>, the <em>Westward
Ho</em>, the <em>Cubore</em>, and the French cruiser <em>Dupetit
Thouars</em>. When the S.O.S. calls came, the
<em>Corsair</em> hurried to stand by, but other naval vessels
happened to be nearer the scene and were able to
save the survivors, or the ship managed to remain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>afloat, as in the case of the <em>Westward Ho</em>. A cruise
in August, beginning on the ill-omened 13th, turned
out to be anything but monotonous, from start
to finish. The air was full of tragic messages from
torpedoed ships. It was like a dying flurry of the
German submarine campaign.</p>

<p>The excitement began with this entry in the
<em>Corsair’s</em> record:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>S.S. <em>Tivives</em> (third ship in right-hand column) signalled
“Torpedo just passed our stern from starboard.”
This ship notified <em>Aphrodite</em> by radio. Went to general
quarters and searched but saw nothing except whales
and porpoises. Wind was light and sea smooth. French
destroyer <em>Aisne</em>, which was astern of us, apparently
intercepted radio as he was observed to be searching.</p>
</div>

<p>A little later in this voyage came the following
tale of disaster, as caught by the radio:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Intercepted from <em>Marseilles</em>, “<em>Montanan torpedoed</em>.”</p>

<p>Intercepted from <em>Noma</em>, “<em>Westbridge torpedoed</em>.”</p>

<p>Intercepted from Aphrodite, “<em>Cubore torpedoed</em>, 10
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> <em>Friday</em>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em> had left their outward-bound
convoy at this time, according to orders, to
steer for the rendezvous and make contact with a
fleet of fourteen ships bound in for France. During
the night a green Véry light flared against the
cloudy sky to the southward. The <em>Corsair</em> headed
for it at full speed, but could find no ship in distress
and it was later conjectured that the signal might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
have come from the French destroyers which had
remained to pick up the survivors of the <em>Cubore</em>.</p>

<p>Soon after this, several lights were sighted close
to the water. It is hard to realize how unusual and
arresting was such a phenomenon as this upon an
ocean where ships had long shrouded themselves in
darkness, screening every ray and glimmer lest it
might betray them to a lurking enemy. The vision
of officers and lookouts had so adapted themselves
to these conditions that they were able to discern
a shadow of a ship a mile away. In this instance,
when vessels’ lights, several of them, were boldly
displayed, the <em>Corsair</em> approached warily until it
was possible to make them out as showing aboard
a little flock of Breton fishermen. It was known
that a French submarine was operating in this
patrol area and the officers of the <em>Corsair</em> plausibly
assumed that the lights might be a decoy
for Fritz, so they concluded not to meddle with
the situation.</p>

<p>Next morning another bevy of fishing vessels was
seen, and the French submarine was with them,
while a steamer was also standing by. Meanwhile
the <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em> had found the inbound
convoy which had also a destroyer escort, and one
of these, the <em>Lamson</em>, ran down to investigate the
startling picture of a submarine calmly loafing
about. The Frenchman promptly exploded a smoke
bomb as the proper recognition signal, for he was
taking no chances with a venomous Yankee destroyer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
which was known to be exceedingly quick
on the trigger when a periscope or conning tower
was etched against the horizon. It was agreed that
there were much more healthy pursuits than to be
ranging the Bay of Biscay in a French submarine.</p>

<p>Fortune had been unkind when the <em>Corsair</em> tried
to pull the <em>Californian</em> into port, but the story was
a happier one when next she had the opportunity
to snatch a good ship from the greedy maw of the
sea. How it was done is summarized in a letter
written by Vice-Admiral Wilson, after the event:</p>

Subject: Commendation.<br>
</p>

<p>The Commander U.S. Naval Forces in France takes
pleasure in commending the excellent seamanship and
judgment displayed by you in the salvage of the Norwegian
steamship <em>Dagfin</em>, as reported in your letter of
September 17, 1918.</p>

<p>The <em>Dagfin</em>, a vessel of 2100 tons, loaded with general
supplies for the Italian Government, had been
totally disabled for six days with a broken shaft when
sighted by the <em>Corsair</em> on September 10th, in Latitude
45° 3′ North, Longitude 8° 03′ West. The U.S.S.
<em>Corsair</em> under your command maintained touch with
the <em>Dagfin</em> until the heavy weather then prevailing
had moderated, and towed her into port, a distance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
three hundred miles through the submarine zone, arriving
at Verdon on September 14th.</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed)  <span class="smcap" style="padding-left: 1em">Wilson</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> happened to find this helpless <em>Dagfin</em>
while scouting in search of a steamer of the convoy
which had somehow gone astray. Insistent radio
calls had failed to awaken a response from this
missing <em>Macona</em>. She appeared to have lost her
bearings and totally mislaid the rendezvous. The
<em>Corsair</em> was too courteous to express annoyance,
but her radio queries became more and more emphatic.
The <em>Macona</em> was as elusive as a Flying
Dutchman. At length the yacht concluded that
she had done her honest duty and so turned in the
general direction of the destroyer rendezvous, still
keeping an eye lifted for the lost sheep of the
convoy.</p>

<p>At 8.35 o’clock on the morning of September
10th, with the <em>Macona</em> still on her mind and the
quest continued, the <em>Corsair</em> descried a steamer
against the misty horizon and soon it was discovered
that she was in distress and making no headway.
By way of precaution the <em>Corsair’s</em> crew
scampered to general quarters, because nothing
could be taken for granted in war-time. Bearing
down, the yacht hovered close to a sea-worn, dingy
Norwegian tramp which wallowed inert and wore
an air of profound discouragement. The sailors of
the <em>Dagfin</em> flourished their caps and yelled with
delight. It was obvious that they yearned to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
plucked out of the submarine zone after six days
and nights of exposure as a stationary target to
any U-boat which might wander that way. Fritz
was too unsportsmanlike to hesitate to shoot at a
sitting bird.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> was willing to undertake a towing
job in order to save the forlorn <em>Dagfin</em> and her
cargo, but it was necessary to ask permission to
leave the duty already assigned, and a radio was
therefore sent to the Admiral at Brest. Meanwhile
the sea was too rough to undertake the ticklish
manœuvre of hooking onto the melancholy Norwegian
and Commander Porter shouted through a
megaphone that he would return and stand by.
There was profound gratitude on the bridge of the
<em>Dagfin</em>, but some deep-sea curses along the rail.
To have rescue so near, and to behold the American
warship depart! It was too much like having the
cup of salvation snatched from one’s lips. Were
they to be left at the mercy of the hell-begotten
submarines?</p>

<p>Steering northward to take another look for the
<em>Macona</em>, Commander Porter changed course to
sweep a wider area and, after several hours, received
a radio reply from Brest, “<em>Stand by Dagfin.
Tug will be sent when weather moderates.</em>” This order
was to be obeyed, blow high, blow low, and through
two stormy days the <em>Corsair</em> rolled and plunged
within sight or signalling distance of the <em>Dagfin</em>
before any attempt could be made to board her. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
was a furious gale, with squalls of snow and sleet,
and the <em>Corsair</em> was so knocked about while heading
into it that she had to turn and run before the
sea under steerageway of four knots. The water
came piling over the stern until the depth charges
had to be shifted amidships to change the trim of
the ship and lift the overhang a little. It was a
man’s-size job, from beginning to end, this playing
friend in need to the <em>Dagfin</em>.</p>

<p>With a sea anchor out, the <em>Dagfin</em> had been lying
broadside to the waves, and this could not have increased
the comfort of her crew. She was swept and
drenched and miserable, and, at best, there is no
luxury in a two-thousand-ton Norwegian tramp.
At last the wind lost something of its evil temper
and the sea was less confused. On the morning of
September 12th the <em>Corsair</em> tried to get a line
aboard, after receiving another radio from Brest,
“<em>Take Dagfin in tow when weather permits</em>.” It was
still too rough to put a boat over, so Commander
Porter steamed to windward and attempted to
float a line, buoyed by empty boxes, to the <em>Dagfin</em>,
but the freighter’s drift was so much greater than
the yacht’s that this scheme failed.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="p2441_ill" style="max-width: 39.125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">THE DAGFIN, BROKEN DOWN AND HELPLESS. THE CORSAIR
STANDS BY</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Nothing daunted, the skipper of the <em>Corsair</em>
hauled his own ship around to leeward and deftly
placed her where the line floated so close to the
<em>Dagfin</em> that it was caught and hauled up by a boat-hook
as she drifted upon it. To this light line the
<em>Corsair</em> secured one hundred and fifty fathoms of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>ten-inch manila hawser, and the <em>Dagfin</em> heaved it
aboard with a turn about the winch. To the end of
the hawser the Norwegians bent fifty fathoms of
chain, for the longer the tow-line the easier the
strain in heavy weather. The <em>Corsair</em> secured her
end of the hawser by means of a wire span leading
to the two after gun mounts, and then she was
ready to go ahead and pull her heart out. It is needless
to remark that the yacht had not been designed
or built to yank disabled freighters through the Bay
of Biscay in the tail-end of a nasty gale of wind.</p>

<p>They went ahead, <em>Corsair</em> and <em>Dagfin</em>, and worked
up to a speed of five knots, reducing it a trifle when
the strain seemed too great. They slogged along in
this manner until 8.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> when the chain parted
and the <em>Dagfin</em> went adrift. Commander Porter
describes the rest of it in his report:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We observed that the <em>Dagfin</em> had broken adrift, and
when attempting to haul in our tow-line I found that
it was weighted with the <em>Dagfin’s</em> chain which had
parted in the hawse-pipe. A six-inch line was bent
and used as a messenger to the forward capstan, but
as this would hold only four turns, which rendered,
the starboard capstan was used to assist. No lead
blocks of sufficient size were available to keep the line
clear of the deck-house, and both houses were damaged.
It was difficult to stopper and secure the messenger
to the wet hawser. This was chafed its entire
length, although the ship went ahead slowly to angle
the hawser slightly and reduce the bend over the lip
of the chock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>After three hours’ work the hawser was all in and
the chain let go. Had conditions been favorable, of
course the chain could have been hove in through the
hawse-pipe, but I desired to intercept the French tug
<em>Penguin</em>, sent out from Brest, which was then close
by. The strain had unlaid the hawser, and releasing
the chain allowed the turns to take up again. Removing
numerous kinks from a wet, ten-inch rope is a long,
tedious job.</p>

<p>As the tug had passed us in the night and was not
in sight at daylight, I closed in to pick up our tow.
Attempting to throw a line on board, we could not get
near enough to reach, as there was still a moderate
swell and we were both rolling and surging. A boat was
lowered and our hawser bent to the <em>Dagfin’s</em> cable, and
at 7.45 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we went ahead at six knots. The average
speed for twenty-six and a half hours was actually six
and a quarter knots.</p>

<p>At 8.15 the <em>Penguin</em> arrived and I had difficulty in
communicating, as she could not comprehend semaphore
signals nor was our language perfectly clear to
them. Our radio communication had been very good,
although I was more reluctant to use it than was the
<em>Penguin</em>, especially in stating latitude and longitude.
To my question, “What are your orders?” the reply
was, “Bordeaux.” She also informed me that she could
tow four knots and as this would not bring us into
port before dark of the following day, I decided to continue
towing and requested that the <em>Penguin</em> escort.
I considered that the advantages of greater speed and
a much shorter time at sea gave us the larger margin
of safety.</p>

<p>In my opinion (with a very limited experience in
towing) the method adopted was by far the best way
of towing a ship. Not only is the windlass usually the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
strongest and most convenient place to secure to, but
in the absence of a very long hawser the weight of
chain sagging down makes an effective spring. There
was never any undue strain and the <em>Dagfin’s</em> chain
could not have parted if it had been in good condition.</p>
</div>

<p>In the early morning of September 14th the
<em>Corsair</em> trailed into the mouth of the Gironde,
doggedly kicking along at six knots, with the Norwegian
water-bruiser dragging in her wake. There
the <em>Penguin</em> took hold and the yacht went on
alone to a berth at Pauillac, none the worse for the
experience. It was all in the job, not so sensational
as dropping depth bombs on a submarine, but perhaps
requiring more courage, endurance, and seamanship.
Commander Porter’s description of the
tussle with the hawser is highly technical, but one
catches glimpses of the hard and heavy toil of the
sea and the ability to do the right thing in time of
stress which comes only with experience. The sailors
of the <em>Corsair</em>, many of them landlubbers only
a year before, were learning the tricks of the trade.</p>

<p>It was back to the convoys again, the same old
round of discomfort at sea and coaling ship in port,
but the spirit of the great adventure had not been
dulled. By way of change and respite, the <em>Corsair</em>
was twice chosen to carry distinguished official
visitors from one French base to another. The first
occasion was on August 24th when the passengers
comprised the party of members of the House
Committee on Naval Affairs who were inspecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
for themselves the American naval and military
forces overseas—Chairman L. P. Padgett, D. J.
Riordan, W. L. Hensley, J. R. Connelly, W. B.
Oliver, W. W. Venable, J. C. Wilson, T. S. Butler,
W. J. Browning, J. R. Farr, S. E. Mudd. J. A.
Peters, and F. C. Hicks.</p>

<p>They were the guests of the <em>Corsair</em> from Royan
to the great American aviation base at Pauillac,
and their enthusiastic approval of the work of the
Navy in the war was pleasant for the crew of the
<em>Corsair</em> to hear. Their report, later submitted to
the Secretary of the Navy, contained this non-partisan
opinion, signed by Republican and Democratic
members alike:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The committee visited and inspected the United
States naval activities at Bordeaux, Moutchic, Pauillac,
Rochefort, La Rochelle, La Pallice, Fromentine, Paimbœuf,
Saint-Nazaire, Montoir, Le Croisic, L’Orient,
Île Tudy, and Brest. The amount of money expended
at these various stations mounts into the hundreds of
millions of dollars and the activities involve the employment
of thousands upon thousands of men. They
represent activities on land and water, under the water,
and in the air. They involve transportation of troops,
munitions, equipment, food, and clothing from the
United States into France of the value of untold millions.
The duties and responsibilities of the Navy were
to escort and convoy ships transporting troops, and
all manner of effort and activity in the air, patrolling
the seas against German submarines, and safeguarding
the arrival and departure of ships, the construction of
bases for the operation and the care of the enormous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>aviation organization, and also at the various bases
providing first aid and hospital accommodations for
the sick and disabled and the establishment of sanitary
conditions, housing facilities, and numerous other
activities essential to the proper care of the men, besides
the many other efforts essential to the successful
prosecution of the war.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The whole work was so colossal that while there
may have been mistakes and matters subject to criticism
in small details, they were lost in the magnitude
of the success accomplished. Taken as a whole, by and
large, the Navy has achieved a great work and is entitled
to approval and commendation.</p>
</div>

<p>Late in October the word came to the <em>Corsair</em>
that the Commander-in-Chief of the Atlantic
Fleet, Admiral Henry T. Mayo, and staff, would be
graciously pleased to use the yacht (or fourth-class
gunboat, to be precise) to take them from Royan
to Pauillac. Now a four-starred admiral is absolutely
top-hole in naval rank and dignity, and the
three gold stripes above the broad band on his
sleeve are viewed with awe and bedazzlement by
the younger officers. To be a vice-admiral, or even
a rear admiral, is a resounding distinction, but an
admiral is so much more imposing that there are
very few of him extant.</p>

<p>You may be sure that the <em>Corsair</em> was fit for
minute inspection when the Commander-in-Chief
of the Atlantic Fleet stepped aboard at Royan,
with side boys at the gangway and the boatswain’s
mate to pipe him with proper ceremony. The ship’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
officers found him to be the affable gentleman and
manly sailor which his reputation in the Navy had
led them to expect. Admiral Mayo later recalled
this trip in a letter to the writer of this story of the
Corsair, and was kind enough to say:</p>

<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>Your letter of August 12th with reference to the war
story of Mr. J. P. Morgan’s yacht <em>Corsair</em> reached me
while absent on leave. My only opportunity to observe
the <em>Corsair</em> was in a very short trip during which I was
a passenger on board, but I do not hesitate to say that
I received a most favorable impression as to the condition
of the ship and the efficiency of the personnel
at that time, and that the reports as to the general
efficiency and good work of the vessel during her service
on the French coast were of an extremely high
character.</p>

<span class="fs80">IN THE RADIO-ROOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> this strange warfare against an enemy who
fought, for the most part, under the sea, there
was no more effective agency than the wireless
telegraph or radio. It enabled the convoys to receive
warnings and to steer safe courses, it brought
help to hundreds of ships in distress, and as an
offensive weapon enabled the Allied naval forces
to locate and destroy a large number of German
submarines. Without the highly developed employment
of radio communication, it would have been
impossible to protect the transportation of troops,
food, and material. More than any other factor, the
radio won the war at sea.</p>

<p>As soon as directional wireless was perfected and
used, it became practicable to fix the position of a
U-boat by means of the messages sent from it, and,
as Admiral Sims has said, “Their commanders were
particularly careless in the use of wireless. The
Germanic passion for conversation could not be
suppressed, even though this national habit might
lead to the most serious consequences. Possibly
also the solitary submarine felt lonely; at any rate,
as soon as it reached the Channel or the North Sea,
it started an almost uninterrupted flow of talk. The
U-boats communicated principally with each other,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
and also with the Admiralty at home, and in doing
this they gave away their position to the assiduously
listening Allies. The radio direction-finder,
by which we can instantaneously locate the position
from which a wireless message is sent, was the
mechanism which furnished much of this information.
Of course, the Germans knew that their messages
revealed their locations, for they had direction-finders
as well as we, but the fear of discovery did
not act as a curb upon a naturally loquacious
nature.”</p>

<p>The radio service of the <em>Corsair</em> was considered
unusually efficient by no less an authority than
Admiral Wilson, who had occasion to write the
following commendation:</p>

</p>

<p>1. An important message from the U.S.S. <em>Seattle</em>,
addressed to the Commander U.S. Naval Forces in
France, was intercepted by the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> and forwarded
to destination via the District Commander
Rochefort. This message was received in the Communication
Office, Brest, about three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Sunday, 28

<p>2. The Commander U.S. Naval Forces in France
is greatly pleased with this proof of the alertness and
efficiency of the radio personnel on board the U.S.S.
<em>Corsair</em>. The message was not heard by the French
high powered station, Brest, and while it was heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
by the Flag Radio Station in Brest, it was not copied
in its entirety because of interference from near-by
stations, and the correct copy as received from the
U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> was of great assistance.</p>

<p class="right">

<br>

<p>The Communications Officer of the ship, Ensign
Gray, took the keenest interest in maintaining the
radio operations at the top notch and a technical
training at Annapolis aided a natural ability for
this sort of work. The chief radio operator, H. C.
Breckel, was an unusually valuable man for his
position and felt a pride in the reputation of the
<em>Corsair’s</em> radio-room which was shared by his
“gang” of assistants. The spirit of the organization
was indicated in the incident which caused
Admiral Wilson to compliment it. The yacht was
moored at Pauillac at the time, and was not required
to keep a radio watch, but the operators
were on the job nevertheless. The <em>Seattle</em> was standing
by a Luckenbach steamer, more than a thousand
miles out at sea, which had stripped its turbines
and was in urgent need of help from Brest.
The message went through because the <em>Corsair</em>
caught and relayed it.</p>

<p>Every hour of the day and night an operator sat
at a table in the little room which none of the crew
was allowed to enter. With a receiver clamped to
his head, he listened and heard a myriad faint and
phantom voices. The air was filled with them. The
mystery, the incredible magic and romance of it all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
had become commonplace. Ships were talking to
each other hundreds of miles apart, mere routine
sometimes, and then the call for help, or the thrilling
report of an escape from a submarine attack.
And woven through it all was the continuous communication
of the high-powered shore stations
which shot into space the secret orders and inquiries
of admiralties and war departments and
statesmen.</p>

<p>The radio log of the <em>Corsair</em> recorded an immense
variety of conversations, some of them quite informal,
such as this chat with another vessel of the
Breton Patrol:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“What do you know? What did you see last night?”</p>

<p>“We don’t know anything. We saw two submarines
last night.”</p>

<p>“We saw a ship torpedoed about 7.00 this morning,
but did not see the submarine.”</p>

<p>“Have you been copying much?”</p>

<p>“We have been copying mostly GLD messages and
SOS messages and a few CHGT.”</p>

<p>“Here is an SOS that came in at 1.10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>—CG.
GLD de FFK de “VEK” 47:45 08:40 W. 11025.”</p>

<p>“We got that one and it did not mean that the last
message was at 8.00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> last night. We have got a few
SOS messages. Have heard a lot of work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you get that Allo from FFK?”</p>

<p>“I just got part of it and am waiting for a repetition.”</p>

<p>“Here it is. Allo 47:30 09:34 W. 1219.</p>

<p>“Thanks. Thanks.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<p>The garrulous U-boats seem to have kept up an
endless stream of chatter, and the radio force of
the <em>Corsair</em> learned to know and identify some of
them, by their manner of sending, as if they were
old acquaintances. One of the reports will give an
idea of this curious interchange of communication
which was carried on between hostile craft, unseen
and hunting each other with deadly intent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On November 21, 1917, the <em>Corsair</em>, <em>Smith</em>, <em>Preston</em>,
<em>Flusser</em>, and <em>Lamson</em> were returning to Base, position
approximately Latitude 47° 30′ North, Longitude 8°
40′ West. A number of enemy submarines were intercommunicating
as follows:</p>

<p>At 8.36 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> one sub called another who answered,
and two messages were sent. These signals came in
very strong which indicated that subs were close to
us.</p>

<p>At 8.59 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the same sub transmitted another message
to the one communicated with before.</p>

<p>At 9.01 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a different sub called three others, one
of which was the first sender.</p>

<p>At 9.18 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Bruges began sending a message to the
sub that called at 9.01 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>At 9.57 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Bruges was still heard.</p>

<p>At 10.16 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> a different sub called another which
was the one who received the messages at 8.36 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>At 9.36 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the <em>Corsair</em> was called and received a
message from Brest.</p>

<p>At 10.54 and again at 10.56 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> the <em>Corsair</em> was
called by an enemy submarine using P.F.B., the same
call used by Brest.</p>

<p>At 10.59 <em>Corsair</em> answered and told him to go ahead.
Sub sent “3 H 5” and then his signals died out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>At 11.04 <em>P.M.</em> sub called <em>Corsair</em> and told <em>Corsair</em> to
go ahead with message.</p>

<p>At 11.10 <em>P.M.</em> the same sub called a British convoy.</p>

<p>At 11.15 <em>P.M.</em> sub called <em>Corsair</em> and said go ahead
with message.</p>

<p>At 11.16 <em>Corsair</em> called sub and sent a message, the
groups of which were taken from several intercepted
German messages.</p>

<p>At 11.17 sub acknowledged <em>Corsair’s</em> message.</p>

<p>At 11.25 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> sub called <em>Corsair</em> and asked for a
repetition of the second group.</p>

<p><em>Corsair</em> did not answer.</p>

<p>Sub repeated message. This time he was impatient
as he said “Go ahead” twice.</p>

<p>The subs continued to intercommunicate during the
night, and also with Bruges.</p>
</div>

<p>The radio service of the <em>Corsair</em> in the war zone
was so important and essential a part of her activities
that a description of it in some detail seems
well worth recounting. Chief Radio Electrician
H. F. Breckel went to the trouble of preparing a
narrative which reads as follows, and it goes without
saying that he was the man best fitted to undertake
such a task:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I reported on board the U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em>, then at the
Navy Yard, Brooklyn, during the last week in May,
1917, in accordance with orders from the Bureau of
Navigation. At that time I was attached to the U.S.S.
<em>Ohio</em>, then at Yorktown, Virginia, which was the war
base of the Atlantic Fleet. Reporting to Ensign Gray,
Communications Officer of the <em>Corsair</em>, I was told that
I would be in charge of the operation of the radio
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>department and to get things in shape for a long cruise
away from any established base of supplies.</p>

HIGHLY EFFICIENT “RADIO GANG”</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<p>My first step was to make sure of a personnel which
would furnish efficient service under all conditions.
Four operators were necessary and this number was
soon sent to the ship, and a better group of men could
not have been found in any vessel. The radio force
comprised:</p>

<p>Ensign Gray, U.S.N.R.F. (Radio Officer)</p>

<p>Harry F. Breckel, U.S.N. (Chief Electrician, Radio)</p>

<p>James A. Plummer, U.S.N.R.F. (Electrician, 1st
Class, Radio)</p>

<p>Meriam H. Swan, U.S.N.R.F. (Electrician, 2nd
Class, Radio)</p>

<p>Ivan E. Davis, U.S.N. (Electrician, 2nd Class,
Radio)</p>

<p>Each man was given a thorough examination when
he reported on board and the results indicated that
all of them were proficient and reliable operators.
We promptly set to work and the radio-room fairly
hummed, day and night. The transmitting apparatus
was inspected, calibrated to the proper wave lengths,
and tested. The receiving apparatus was also overhauled,
minor repairs made, and adjusted to receive
the various wave lengths used by other U.S. naval
vessels. Then the inspection included the various
switch-boards, storage batteries, heating and lighting
systems, motor generators, etc.</p>

<p>The radio-room was located on the main deck with
doors opening directly on deck, so it was necessary to
devise a lighting circuit which should automatically
switch off the lamps when the doors were opened, as
the ship moved in total darkness. After stocking up
with spare parts, the antenna was given careful attention,
for nothing is more exasperating than to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
your wires carry away and to have to replace them in
heavy weather.</p>

<p>During a trial run in Long Island Sound, the radio
installation was tested under normal conditions of
service and was found to be in first class shape. The
very fine type of apparatus aboard the <em>Corsair</em> made
only a few changes necessary in order to make it conform
with the standards of the Navy. We operators
were fortunate in stepping into a radio-room so efficiently
and completely furnished. There was a large
desk with space for the Radio Officer in his work of
coding and decoding despatches, a bookshelf, several
chairs, a large wall settee which I used as a bunk, and
a safe in which were kept the code books, ciphers, and
other confidential material. With regard to comfort,
there was no better “radio shack” aboard any ship
of the Navy.</p>

<p>There was steam heat and running water which was
cold, but we discovered that we could obtain hot water
for scrubbing clothes, paint-work, etc., from the steam
radiator. I ask you, fellow “Sparks” and “ex-Sparks”
of the Navy, can you picture such comfort and convenience
in a real, honest-to-goodness man-of-war?
And it all helped to maintain good service. Our gang
also had a percolator along with the necessary watts
from the ship’s generator, and the outfit could turn
out a brew of “boiler compound” that would keep a
Mississippi colored gentleman with the hook-worm
wide awake. We surely had a home on board the old
<em>Corsair</em>!</p>

<p>At last, on that memorable 14th of June the ship
pointed her bow to the eastward and steamed slowly
down the Bay, with the dreary moans of fog-horns
for farewell, and no cheers or blaring bands or fluttering
flags. In the radio-room there was very little to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
do as we had been instructed to keep communication
down to the minimum, for the enemy might infer from
the amount of radio traffic in the air that some unusual
movement was under way, or he might plot the exact
positions by means of a direction-finder or radio compass.
At the beginning of the war, naval vessels had a
characteristic “spark” or “tone” quite different from
the average commercial or naval shore stations, and
an operator familiar with these variations could readily
tell which was which. It was easy to understand why
the troop convoys were kept as silent as possible.</p>

<p>For several days there was little radio work besides
copying the Time and Weather reports which were
broadcasted from the Arlington station, and intercepting
for the skipper’s information all radio traffic
heard by the operator on watch. In mid-ocean almost
nothing was heard because we were out of range of the
ordinary “spark stations,” but our “long wave” receiver,
constructed by our own force, had no trouble
in copying messages from such stations as Darien
(Canal Zone), Tuckerton, New Jersey, Boston, and
other high-powered naval radio stations while the
<em>Corsair</em> was half way across the Atlantic. It was excellent
work when you consider the fact that the special
apparatus and “hook up” used were of the simplest
type and that an amateur Audion detector bulb was
employed.</p>

<p>When about five days out, the real job began. The
<em>Corsair</em> was called by the flagship <em>Seattle</em> and a long
code message received by the operator on watch. The
apparatus functioned perfectly and there was every
reason to believe that very little trouble, barring accidents,
would be encountered. Soon we received orders
to get in touch with the <em>Birmingham</em>, flagship of the
second division of the convoy and to forward a message<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
to her. After joining the second division, there was
absolute silence for several days, and no radio signals
were heard at all until we drew near to the coast of
France and the edge of the war zone. Then traffic began
to be heavy and the operators were busy copying messages
into the “intercepted log book” almost every
minute of the day and night.</p>

<p>This log was of great value to the captain, for the
radio station of a fighting ship is an information bureau
which maintains intimate touch with events occurring
in other areas. In these days a man-of-war without
a radio-room would be almost deaf, dumb, and blind.
We knew that we were actually in the war when the
distress calls from sinking ships or those which were
under attack by submarines began to come hurtling
through the air. This in itself was enough to prove the
priceless value of the radio in saving life. For some
time I kept a chart upon which were plotted all the
positions of vessels which transmitted radio calls for
help, but within two months so many of these calls
had been received that I had little space left in which
to record the new ones.</p>

<p>A typical distress call would come in like this:</p>

<p><em>SOS SOS SOS</em> 48° 12′ <em>North</em>, 12° 00′ <em>West</em>. <em>Torpedoed
Sinking.</em> <em>S.S. John Luckenbach</em> 1025.</p>

<p>When a submarine was sighted by an Allied vessel, a
simple form of position report was broadcasted by the
operator at once, as follows:</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allo</i> (<em>French for Hello</em>) 49° 15′ <em>N.</em> 09° 06′ <em>W.</em> 0815
<em>MXA</em>.</p>

<p>The radio operator continued to broadcast these
signals until an acknowledgment was received from
one of the larger, more powerful coastal radio stations
which immediately broadcasted the message on high
power to all ships and stations for their information.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
The radio operators on vessels at sea which received
this general warning would at once notify the captain
who could thereby avoid the dangerous locality or
proceed to the aid of the ship in distress.</p>

<p>After we had arrived at Saint-Nazaire the work of
the radio-room did not cease, for we kept a continuous
watch, intercepting every message of importance which
we were able to copy. When the <em>Corsair</em> was ordered
to proceed to Brest, it was necessary to observe the
regulation which required all vessels desiring to enter
that port to transmit by radio a special form of message,
addressed to the port authorities, requesting permission.
Failure to do so would have risked bombardment
by the shore batteries. The reply from Brest
stated whether or not the channel was clear of mines
and enemy submarines.</p>

<p>The radio shore station at Brest was about five
miles from the American naval base and was an old
type, low frequency installation. The “spark” at the
time of our arrival was very difficult to read through
atmospheric electrical disturbances, and did not have
sufficient range. However, after the American base
was permanently organized, a modern installation replaced
the old one and American naval operators were
placed on duty to handle all radio traffic that concerned
our naval and other shipping. This was a great improvement
over the early method of letting the French
operators handle it.</p>

<p>When the <em>Corsair</em> went out on patrol duty, the radio
force caught many distress calls and submarine warnings,
and the information enabled the ship to render
aid on several occasions. In working with the Aphrodite
when we covered adjoining patrol areas, the captains
were able to exchange information concerning new
situations to be dealt with and to operate in concert.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
The messages intercepted from the British radio station
at Lands End were particularly useful and the
operators kept a sharp lookout for them. At least one
crew of survivors of a French fishing vessel was rescued
by the <em>Corsair</em> because of a message intercepted from
this coastal station.</p>

<p>In the later duty on escort with the convoys, the
amount of traffic handled by the radio force was largely
increased. Because of difficulties unforeseen, such as
stormy weather, break-downs, etc., it was rarely that a
convoy was sighted in the exact position designated.
The radio enabled the escort commander to ask the
convoy for definite information as to location, course,
direction, and speed. It also kept the convoys clear of
the enemy mine-fields. I recall an instance when the
<em>Corsair</em> put into Penzance. The day before sailing from
that port the radio operator on duty intercepted a
message from the French high-powered station at
Nantes, stating that the entrance to Brest had been
mined by German submarines and that all ships were
forbidden to approach. The <em>Corsair</em> thereupon waited
at Penzance with her convoy until word was received
that the Brest channel had been swept clear.</p>

<p>The severest test for the radio personnel came in
December, 1917, when a hurricane almost finished the
yacht. Early in the storm it was almost impossible for
the operator on watch to stay in his chair although it
was screwed to the deck. The climax came in the dead
of night when a terrific sea struck the <em>Corsair</em> on the
port side, stove in bulkheads, and lifted the hatch over
the radio-room clear of the deck and allowed about a
ton of icy sea water to pour in. The operator was half-drowned,
as well as the whole installation, and the
apparatus was rendered useless for the time. As the
seas got worse, the water forced itself into the radio-room
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>through the doors in spite of the fact that every
crack was calked as tightly as possible. More than
a foot of water piled up on the floor and there was no
system of drainage, so every time the vessel rolled or
pitched it all swashed up at one side of the room or
the other.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>About this time the depth charges washed overboard
and I can tell you that the “Sparks” on board the
<em>Corsair</em> were sure they were up against a big proposition.
Here we were, with the entire receiver swimming
in water, the transmitting panel splashed with
it, the motor generator submerged most of the time,
our lead-in insulator and lead-in frequently grounded
by the huge waves which swept clear over us, and yet
facing a probable order from the skipper to send out a
distress call. We were all soaked to the skin, impossible
to brew any Java to warm us up, and all the time
working hard to get the apparatus back into shape.</p>

<p>I gave up the receiver as hopeless and tried to clear
the grounds on the motor generator while the rest of
the gang tried to bale out the water, but the ocean
came in faster than they could scoop it out. However,
we managed to keep the water below the level of the
commutator and the collector rings of the motor generator,
and after clearing some of the worst grounds,
during which the toilers were most beautifully “jolted,”
we gave the transmitter a short test and it worked fairly
well, considering the circumstances. Then I made my
way up to the boat deck and between seas managed to
clean a layer of salt off the lead-in insulator and gave
it a heavy coat of oil.</p>

<p>Plummer and the rest of the gang were drying the
various switches and other parts of the transmitter
and we managed to fix things so that an S.O.S. could
have been sent out. And all hands thought it was about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
time to shoot it. The deck force succeeded in nailing
up some doors and canvas along the weather side of
the radio-room, which was all that prevented it from
being smashed in. If our bulkheads had gone there
would have been no chance of keeping the transmitter
in working condition.</p>

<p>When we found refuge at Vigo, a survey of the damage
was made. The radio-room was simply a mess, like
the rest of the ship, but within eight hours we had the
entire installation restored to the best of health and
ready for any emergency. Considering the fact that
the radio-room had been flooded with sea water for
two and a half days, we flattered ourselves that it was
mighty speedy work.</p>

<p>During the long stay at Lisbon for repairs, we made
a thorough overhauling of the radio equipment but
had no traffic to handle excepting the press news from
the Eiffel Tower which we copied for the crew and for
the American Legation. Our visit at Lisbon will always
be remembered as a very happy one. The people were
most hospitable and seemed to enjoy entertaining the
bluejackets. The radio-room was still in communication
with Brest, 850 miles distant, but there was no
occasion for talking with the base station.</p>

<p>The work of the radio force while on escort duty,
after we returned to France, was much like that of the
earlier cruises. It made us proud to receive a letter
of commendation from Admiral Wilson for forwarding
a message intercepted from the <em>Seattle</em>. I was sorry
when, for a time, I was transferred to shore duty with
the District Commander at Cherbourg and had to
leave the radio-room of the <em>Corsair</em>. Plummer, my right-hand
man, was left in charge of the situation. Shortly
before the yacht sailed to the United States, I was
lucky enough to make a little visit aboard. Nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
would have pleased me more than a chance to make the
homeward bound voyage with the old crowd.</p>

<p>When the <em>Corsair</em> went to France, she had as fine a
crew of men as were ever assembled on a deck. The
radio force, with whom I worked and lived, got on
splendidly together and made a record of successful
operation which, I feel sure, compared favorably with
that of any other naval vessel engaged in similar duties
and laboring under the same kind of difficulties.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LONG ROAD HOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Although</span> foreshadowed by rumor and report,
the news of the armistice which meant
the end of the war came as a certain shock to the
ships and sailors on the French coast. It was curiously
difficult to realize, because long service had
made the hard routine a matter of habit and the
mind had adjusted itself to the feeling that things
were bound to go on as they were for an indefinite
period. The old life, as it had been lived in the days
of peace, seemed vaguely remote and discarded,
and the Navy thought only of guarding convoys
and hunting submarines, world without end. Then,
at a word, on November 11, 1918, the great game
was finished, the U-boats turned sullenly in the
direction of their own bases to harry the seas no
more as outlaws, and the darkened transports and
cargo steamers ran without fear, the cabin windows
ablaze with light.</p>

<p>It was this which most impressed the crews of the
yachts and destroyers, that they would steer no
more shrouded courses and dice with the peril of
collision while they zigzagged among the huge ships
that threatened to stamp them under, or dodged
to find the rendezvous where the routes of traffic
crossed and the nights were black and menacing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
More by instinct than by sight, the Navy had
learned to feel its way in the dark, and it was actually
true that the ocean seemed unfamiliar when
the running lights shone again and the almost forgotten
rules of the road had to be observed.</p>

<p>The job was finished. Two million soldiers were
in France to testify that the Navy had done its
share. And now, as soon as the sense of bewilderment
lifted, with one common impulse all hands of
this battered, intrepid fleet that flew the Stars and
Stripes talked and dreamed of going home. There
was nothing else to it. All the sundered ties and
yearnings awoke and the faces of these young
sailors were turned westward, toward Sandy Hook
instead of the roadstead of Brest and the fairway
of the Gironde. Every wife and sweetheart was
tugging at the other end of the long tow-rope.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> went to sea for her last convoy
cruise on October 24th. Returning from this errand,
she was ordered to Bordeaux and was moored
there until November 10th for necessary repair
work. On the day of the armistice she dropped
down the river to Royan and the log-book makes
no mention of one of the greatest events in the history
of mankind, excepting this entry in the “Communication
Record,” as a signal sent from shore
by the Port Officer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Have you any colors you can lend the French balloon
station to-day?</p>
</div>

<p>In the sailors’ diaries there was one brief note,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
but it concerned itself also with a mishap to the
beef stew served on that day, as a matter of importance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Armistice signed. Great stuff. Found a cockroach in
the mulligan. Could you beat it?</p>
</div>

<p>From Royan the <em>Corsair</em> moved to Verdon, and
there received orders on November 13th to proceed
to sea and intercept incoming ships, warning them
how to keep clear of mine-fields and instructing
them as to destinations. The yacht went out, but
received a radio next day from the District Commander,
telling her to return to Pauillac. Another
message set the crew to wondering:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Corsair</em> detached from this District and will go to
Brest. State requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>As soon as he could get ashore, at midnight,
Commander Porter used the telephone to Rochefort
and was informed by the District Commander
that the <em>Corsair</em> “had a fine job ahead of her,” but
here the information stopped. This was just enough
to set everybody guessing wildly and once more
“the scuttle-butt was full of rumors.” Pursuant to
instructions the <em>Corsair</em> promptly took on supplies
and sailed for Brest, arriving on November 16th.
There the other yachts were all astir with the expectation
of flying their homeward-bound pennants.
They were soon to set out on the blithe voyage
across the Atlantic, by way of the Azores and
Bermuda—the first division comprising the <em>Vidette</em>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span><em>Corona</em>, <em>Sultana</em>, <em>Emiline</em>, and <em>Nokomis</em>; in the
second division the <em>Christabel</em>, <em>May</em>, <em>Remlik</em>, and
<em>Wanderer</em>, veterans of the coastal convoy routes
and the wild weather offshore.</p>

<p>It was decreed otherwise for the <em>Corsair</em> and she
was to remain six months longer in foreign waters,
thereby rounding out a service of almost two years
as a naval vessel. Captain John Halligan, chief of
staff to Admiral Wilson, was kind enough to end
the suspense and vouchsafe the information that
the <em>Corsair</em> would go to England and hoist the flag
of Rear Admiral S. S. Robison who was about to
sail for Kiel to inspect what was left of the German
Navy. This was a highly interesting assignment
and the <em>Corsair</em> was envied by the other ships. In
order to make her fit to serve as a flagship the depleted
stock of china, linen, and silver was replaced,
after persuasive arguments with the naval storekeeper
at Brest. Several officers were detached at
this time, which made room on board for an admiral’s
staff. These were Ensign J. W. McCoy,
Lieutenant S. K. Hall (J.G.), Lieutenant C. R.
Smith (J.G.), Lieutenant R. V. Dolan (J.G.), and
Ensign A. V. Mason, Assistant Engineer. The new
arrivals in the war-room were Ensign E. F. O’Shea
and Lieutenant E. B. Erickson, Assistant Paymaster.</p>

<p>On November 18th the <em>Corsair</em> sailed from Brest
with the expectation of acting as the flagship representing
the United States in the surrender and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
internment of the naval forces of Imperial Germany.
As passengers she carried to England Captain
E. P. Jessop, U.S.N., and Commander C. T.
Hutchins, Jr., who had been commissioned to examine
the German submarines. The orders included
a stop at Saint Helens, Isle of Wight, for routing
instructions. There the <em>Corsair</em> was told to seek
further information from the patrol off Folkstone.
War restrictions concerning war channels, mine-fields,
pilotage, and closed ports were still in force.</p>

<p>Commander Porter jogged along until Folkstone
was reached in the evening, and was there informed
that there was no patrol, but that the channel was
clear to Dover. A fog came down thick while the
<em>Corsair</em> waited off Dover Breakwater for a pilot,
but none appeared, so she went on her way through
the Strait and past the Goodwin Sands, pausing to
inquire at the North Gull light-ship if anybody had
seen a Thames pilot thereabouts. Deal was suggested
as a good place to look, so the <em>Corsair</em> returned
and anchored there at midnight. No pilot
could be found, however, so at five o’clock in the
morning the skipper hove up his mud-hook and
“trailed along” as he said, with some ships that
were bound to the northward.</p>

<p>The pace was too slow to suit him, so he joined
company with another group of vessels ahead and
discovered, a little later, that they were mine-sweepers
engaged in clearing the channel. This was
considered a fairly good joke on the skipper. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
said good-bye to this dangerous flotilla and steamed
along alone, anchoring twice in a fog that was like
a wool blanket, and fetched up for the night eight
miles below Sheerness.</p>

<p>Asking permission of the patrol next morning to
proceed up the Thames to Gravesend, the <em>Corsair</em>
learned that her destination had been changed to
Sheerness. Here she met with a disappointment.
The cruiser <em>Chester</em> arrived unexpectedly and was
selected as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robison,
as was quite proper. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody
good, however, and just after starting north
for Rosyth and the Grand Fleet, the <em>Chester</em> was
compelled to return with machinery disabled. The
<em>Corsair</em> was ordered to proceed to Scotland in place
of the cruiser and she left the Thames on November
30th to steam up into the gray North Sea, and the
great war base near Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It was fondly believed on board that the yacht
would be employed to take the American admiral
across to visit the German naval ports, but they
found him in the British battleship <em>Hercules</em> with
the other admirals of the Allied naval commission,
and they all sailed next day in this big ship for
Kiel. This was rather hard medicine for the <em>Corsair</em>,
to be disappointed again after singing for so long
in hearty chorus that on the Kiel Canal they’d
float and likewise knock the hell out of Heligoland,
and now they were deprived of a sight of these notorious
nests of the enemy’s warships.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>It was something to remember, however, this
visit to the North Sea and a sojourn with the grim
squadrons of Admiral Sir David Beatty which had,
through four weary, vigilant years held the German
High Sea Fleet in check and made safe the surface
of the seas for the shipping of the world.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> dropped anchor at Rosyth on the
day that the American battleship division sailed
for home, the first-class fighting ships of Rear
Admiral Hugh Rodman which had shared the vigil
at Scapa Flow in the gloomy Orkneys and had
earned that farewell tribute which Admiral Beatty
paid the American officers and men when he called
them his “comrades of the mist.” A storm of British
cheers bade a fare-you-well to the <em>New York</em>
and her sister ships as their flag hoists and semaphores
and blinkers talked for the last time in the
British signal code, which they had used because
they were, not an independent American squadron,
but the Sixth Battle Division of the Grand Fleet
and gladly operating as such.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair’s</em> crew had seen much of the French
Navy on active service, but this was the first opportunity
for intimate contact with British ships and
sailors. They found a spirit of cordial welcome and
there was a pleasant interchange of calls, of entertainment
on shipboard, motion-picture shows, and
inspection of the mighty fighting craft which bore
the scars of Jutland. Shore liberty at Edinburgh
was a most interesting diversion, and the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
sailors found that the Scotch people were fond of
them and proud of the record for behavior left by
the thousands of their comrades who had landed
from Admiral Rodman’s battleships.</p>

<p>After twelve days in the Firth of Forth, the
<em>Corsair</em> was relieved by the <em>Chester</em> and received
orders to report at Portland, England. During the
voyage north, Commander Porter had navigated
through four hundred miles of swept war channels
where the abundance of German mines was presumed
to require the most ticklish care. The cleared
passages were strewn with wrecks and most British
merchantmen were anchoring at night. The <em>Corsair</em>
had picked her way, not in a reckless spirit, but
because she was due to reach her destination at a
specified time and it was the habit of the ship to
arrive when she was expected. While returning
south to Portland, a pilot was taken on at Yarmouth
and casual reference was made to the fact
that the yacht had chosen the north channel into
the mouth of the Thames while coming over from
France.</p>

<p>“My word, but you are lucky beggars!” exclaimed
the ruddy pilot. “You should have gone in
by the south channel, you know. The other one is a
bloomin’ muck o’ mines that ain’t been swept. You
couldn’t wait a week for a bally pilot, eh? The
sportin’ chance! I fancy it’s the proper spirit in a
navy, what?”</p>

<p>At Portland the <em>Corsair</em> found the U.S.S. <em>Bushnell</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
which had served as the mother ship of the American
submarine flotilla in Bantry Bay. With her
waited five mine-sweepers and five submarine
chasers all ready and anxious to sail for home. The
yachts <em>Harvard</em> and <em>Aphrodite</em> had come over from
Brest and were attached to the North Sea patrol.
Later in the winter they were sent to Germany.
The <em>Aphrodite</em> hit a mine en route, but luckily its
action was delayed and, although damaged, she
was able to make port. What aroused eager interest
at Portland was a group of five German submarines,
moored close to the <em>Bushnell</em>, which comprised
an installment of the surrendered fleet of
U-boats. Their frightfulness was done. Meekly they
had crossed the North Sea, at the bidding of the
victors, to be tied up all in a row as a rare show
for the jeering comment of British and American
bluejackets.</p>

<p>To the sailors of the <em>Corsair</em> it was fascinating to
inspect and investigate these uncouth sea monsters
which they had hunted and bombed with no more
mercy than if they had been vermin. Instead of
winning the war for Germany, they had turned
the tide against her by arousing the United States
to launch its armed forces in the cause of the Allies.
And they had branded the German name with infamy
and reddened German hands with the blood
of thousands of slain seamen.</p>

<p>Christmas Day of 1918 was spent in this English
harbor of Portland and the occasion was not as joyous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>as might have been, although the <em>Corsair’s</em> log
of December 24th contained this entry:</p>

<p>The home-made poetry inspired by this Christmas
in exile seemed to lack the punch of former

<p>On the day after this rather subdued Christmas,
the <em>Corsair</em> was informed of her destination, which
was Queenstown, Ireland, and her mission was to
relieve the U.S.S. <em>Melville</em> as the flagship of Admiral
Sims, Commanding the U.S. Naval Forces in European
Waters. The <em>Melville</em>, the last word in naval
construction as a repair and supply ship, had been
nominally the flagship during the service of the
destroyer flotillas at Queenstown, although the
official headquarters and residence of Admiral Sims
were in London. During this time the <em>Melville</em> had
quartered Captain J. R. P. Pringle, the American
chief of staff and his organization which coöperated
with the British Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly in maintaining
and directing the destroyer force.</p>

<p>The elaborate and smoothly running machine of
operation, supply, equipment, and personnel had
come to a halt with the armistice. The destroyers
had fled homeward. The barracks and <em>dépôts</em> for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
material at Passage, a little way up the river, had
been almost emptied, and the great naval aviation
base on the other side of Queenstown Harbor was
like a deserted city. All that remained was what
Admiral Bayly called the job of “cleaning up the
mess.” For this the American chief of staff was required
to linger on the scene, but it was decided to
send the <em>Melville</em> home and the <em>Corsair</em> was elected
to take the place, or, as her men said, “it was wished
on her.”</p>

<p>On December 27th the yacht tied up alongside
the <em>Melville</em> in Queenstown Harbor, and three days
later Captain Pringle and his staff transferred their
offices and living quarters. This group of officers
comprised Commander A. P. Fairfield, Lieutenant
Commander D. B. Wainwright (Pay Corps), Lieutenant
A. C. Davis, Ensign W. B. Feagle. Soon the
<em>Corsair</em> was alone as the only American naval vessel
in this port which had swarmed with the keen activity
of scores of destroyers and thousands of bluejackets.
To build up this force and keep it going at
top speed had been an enormous task, but it was no
slight undertaking to pull it down again. Winter
rains and sodden skies made Queenstown even
drearier than when the liberty parties of destroyer
men had piled ashore to fill the American Sailors’
Club, or surge madly around and around in the
roller-skating rink, or live in hope of cracking the
head of a Sinn Feiner as the most zestful pastime
that could be offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>Dashing young destroyer officers no longer lingered
a little in the pub of the Queen’s Hotel for a
smile from a rosy barmaid with the gift of the
blarney, and a farewell toast before going to sea
again, while the Royal Cork Yacht Club, down by
the landing pier, seemed almost forlorn without
the sociable evenings when American and British
naval officers had swapped yarns of the day’s work
and talked the “hush stuff” about mystery ships
and U-boats that would never see their own ports
again.</p>

<p>High up the steep hillside, the White Ensign flew
from the mast in front of Admiral House, and
Admiral Sir Lewis Bayly, austere, efficient, but
very human, one of the ablest officers of the British
Navy, still toiled at his desk or puttered among his
flower gardens in the rare hours of leisure, but his
occupation as Commander-in-Chief of the Coasts
of Ireland was mostly in the past tense. Soon he
was to retire, with the stripes of a full admiral on
his sleeve and a long list of distinctions following
his name, Knight Commander of the Bath, Companion
of the Victorian Order, the Legion of Honor
of France; but more than these he valued the
friendship and high respect of the American naval
force at Queenstown, memorable because it was
here that, for the first time, the British and the
American navies had worked and dared as one,
salty brothers-in-arms, to conquer the sea and
make it safe against a mutual foe.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>All of this the <em>Corsair</em> perceived in retrospect
while Captain Pringle finished his fine record of
service by disposing of all the odds and ends of
work demanded of him before the Stars and Stripes
could be hauled down and Queenstown finally
abandoned as a base. As soon as the <em>Corsair</em> arrived
in port, opportunity was offered the Reserve officers
and men to quit the ship and go home, instead of
detaining them longer on foreign service. Three
officers and thirty men took advantage of the
chance and felt, fairly enough, that the war was
over and the call of duty no longer imperative.
Other officers came to the ship in their places—A.
T. Agnew, Assistant Surgeon, who had
joined at Rosyth, Ensign C. R. Bloomer, Boatswain
A. R. Beach, and Boatswain H. W. Honeck.</p>

<p>It was a long and tedious duty, lasting almost
three months, this serving as the flagship at Queenstown,
but he also serves who only stands and waits,
and this was true of the <em>Corsair</em>. The aftermath of
the war was mostly drudgery, with all the fiery
incentive and thrilling stimulus removed, but the
need was just as urgent and the Navy responded,
displaying the spirit which was best exemplified
by Rear Admiral Strauss and his mine-laying fleet
which placed a barrier of forty thousand mines
across the upper end of the North Sea and then
manfully, uncomplainingly, spent a whole year in
sweeping them up again.</p>

<p>One pleasant souvenir of the stay at Queenstown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
was a copy of the following letter from Admiral Sir
Lewis Bayly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Captain of the Dockyard has informed me that
valuable assistance was given by officers and men of
the U.S. Navy in extinguishing the fire in the Dockyard
yesterday, Tuesday. I desire to thank you very
much for the assistance so smartly and ably given.</p>
</div>

<p>On March 20th the <em>Corsair</em> left Queenstown for
Spithead and Cowes to meet a number of large
German merchant ships and, as the flagship of
Admiral Sims, represent the United States in the
business of transfer to the American flag, as provided
in the terms of the armistice. The departure
from Ireland caused no heart-breaking regrets,
although many congenial friendships had been
formed ashore. For weeks the crew had been more
interested in sewing stitches in the homeward-bound
pennant than in any attractions that foreign
ports could afford. Rumor had been misleading as
usual, and hopes often deferred.</p>

<p>At Cowes the <em>Corsair</em> found four American destroyers,
the <em>Woolsey</em>, <em>Lea</em>, <em>Yarnell</em>, and <em>Tarbell</em>,
and the naval tug <em>Gypsum Queen</em> which had been
sent to do the work in hand. Drafts of American
sailors had been brought from Brest, La Pallice,
Queenstown, and English ports to man the German
liners after their own crews had been taken out of
them. Commander T. G. Ellyson, U.S.N., acted as
the representative of Admiral Sims and was in
charge of the transfer. While at Cowes he lived on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
board the <em>Corsair</em>, with his staff. The London Times
described the episode as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the last few days a number of German merchant
ships which have been surrendered to the Allies
under the Armistice conditions have arrived at Cowes
roadstead. The Hamburg-American liners <em>Cleveland</em>
and <em>Patricia</em> were the first to arrive, and they were followed
by the <em>Cap Finisterre</em>, the <em>Kaiserin Auguste
Victoria</em>, the <em>Graf Waldersee</em>, the <em>Zeppelin</em>, and the
<em>Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm</em>, making seven of the
eight expected at this port. The <em>La Plata</em> is expected
to arrive in a day or two.</p>

<p>In place of the smart, spick-and-span German merchant
sailors of pre-war days, these large vessels,
ranging up to 24,500 tons, were mostly manned by
motley crews of Germans, many wearing bowler hats
and untidy civilian dress. Many of them speak English
and in conversation showed that they were familiar
with the Solent and local shipping, while others had
been to Cowes in Regatta times. One officer stated
that he had been there on the ex-Kaiser’s yacht <em>Meteor</em>.
These Germans are not allowed ashore but are transferred
to the <em>Cap Finisterre</em>, in which they will return
to Germany when the <em>La Plata</em> arrives. They have
brought their own provisions with them but they have
been reprovisioned here.</p>

<p>New crews have been provided for the surrendered
ships by the American Navy, representatives of which
are superintending the transfer of the crews and the
dispersal of the German ships which have left for
other ports. The <em>Cleveland</em>, <em>Kronprinz Friedrich Wilhelm</em>,
and <em>Pretoria</em> have sailed for Liverpool, the
<em>Kaiserin Auguste Victoria</em> and <em>Graf Waldersee</em> for Brest
and the <em>Zeppelin</em> for Plymouth. The German ships fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
the blue and white flag of the Inter-Allied Nations and
have an American escort, including the armed yacht
<em>Corsair</em>, destroyers, submarine chasers, and store-ships.</p>

<p>The North German Lloyd liner <em>Zeppelin</em>, with an
American crew on board, arrived at Devonport yesterday.
The remainder of the American naval forces at
Plymouth will embark on her to-day, and after coaling
and taking on stores, the <em>Zeppelin</em> will leave for Brest
and the United States.</p>

<p>Up to yesterday twenty-four of the one hundred
German vessels allocated to Leith had arrived there.
A number of the ships were new; in fact this voyage
was their maiden one. When the total is complete, the
vessels will form a very handsome addition to the shipping
in the port. The conduct of the sailors is said to
be satisfactory. There were rumors that there was
among the crews of some of the vessels a revolutionary
spirit, but these had no foundation. The crews are
reported to be eager and willing to do all that is required
of them.</p>
</div>

<p>The duty of taking part in the distribution of
German shipping, in which the naval representatives
of the United States were concerned, took the
<em>Corsair</em> next to Harwich, the important East Coast
base of England, at which the main fleet of German
submarines was surrendered to Rear Admiral
Sir Reginald Tyrwhitt, R.N. It was at Harwich
that the British submarines had rested and refitted
between their perilous patrol tours across the North
Sea when they stalked the U-boat in a deadly game
of hide-and-seek which Fritz lacked the courage to
play. The British losses had been heavy, many a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>gallant submarine erased from the list as missing
with all hands, but the toll of U-boats had been
much greater and the results were worth the price
they cost.</p>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

<p>Out of Harwich had dashed that wonderful light
cruiser division under Admiral Tyrwhitt, always
under two hours’ steaming notice to run north as a
tactical unit of the Grand Fleet or to tear at thirty
knots for the Strait of Dover to help defend and
keep clear the main road to France. And now the
cruisers and destroyers and submarines no longer
moved restlessly in and out of Harwich Harbor to
patrol the North Sea, and Harwich was again a
railway terminus on the route to Antwerp and the
Hook of Holland. As the American flagship, the
<em>Corsair</em> tarried there through part of April before
sailing to Southend to execute similar orders and
duties. England was green and blooming with the
loveliness of its rare springtime, and the men of the
lonely American yacht were more than ever absorbed
in thoughts of flying that homeward-bound
pennant.</p>

<p>At length there came an order from London,
transmitted through the cruiser <em>Galveston</em> which was
also at Southend, that seemed to promise the
<em>Corsair</em> a start on the long road home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On completion of transfer of stores and quota of
draft of the German steamship <em>Brandenburg</em>, you will
proceed to Plymouth, England, with the vessel under
your command, arranging to arrive in the afternoon of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
May 7th. On arrival report to the Commander-in-Chief,
U.S. Naval Forces, European Waters, for use
of the Secretary of the Navy.</p>
</div>

<p>Secretary Daniels and his party were at this time
on their way to France and the United States after
visiting the Allied naval organizations. The <em>Corsair</em>
was designated to carry them from Plymouth to
Brest, and the British Admiralty carried out its
part of the programme with the most punctilious
attention to detail, as is shown in the printed memorandum
under “Devonport General Orders” which
was signed by Admiral Cecil F. Thursby:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Embarkation of Mr. J. Daniels, Secretary of the U.S.
Navy.</em></p>

<p>U.S. Yacht <em>Corsair</em> and one U.S.T.B.D. will arrive
<span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> 7th May and will be berthed as follows,—<em>Corsair</em>
alongside <em>Resolution</em>, bows to southward, if possible.
T.B.D. alongside No. 1 wharf, unless she requires oil
when she will proceed to <em>Orangeleaf</em> and complete with
fuel.</p>

<p>The train conveying Mr. Daniels and party will
arrive at No. 6 wharf at 0800 on Thursday, 8th May.
The Commander-in-Chief will receive Mr. Daniels.
The Vice Admiral Commanding First Battle Squadron
and staff and the Admiral Superintendent are requested
also to be present at the wharf. (Dress No. 5
without swords.)</p>

<p>A working party of three petty officers and twenty
men in No. 5 dress, in charge of a warrant officer, is
to be provided by Depot, and to be at No. 6 wharf by
0745 to transfer baggage from train to <em>Corsair</em>. As soon
as Mr. Daniels and party and all baggage have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
embarked, <em>Corsair</em> will proceed down harbor. Admiral
Superintendent is requested to arrange for a tug to be
in attendance.</p>
</div>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> arrived punctually at Plymouth and
was waiting to obey the foregoing instructions
when, at midnight, there came a telegram which
quite overshadowed the episode of carrying the
Secretary of the Navy, with all due respect to the
dignity of his office. The message, for which the
yacht had waited so long, came in the form of a
smudged carbon copy as sent through the U.S.
Naval Post-Office, but in the eyes of those who
scanned it the document was beautiful. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> hereby detached duty European
Waters. Proceed Brest with Secretary of Navy and
report to Admiral Halstead. Load any personnel for
which space is available and then proceed New York,
touching at Azores if necessary. Transfer any flag
records to U.S.S. <em>Chattanooga</em> before leaving Plymouth.</p>
</div>

<p>Escorted by the American destroyer <em>Conner</em>, the
<em>Corsair</em> made a fast and comfortable run to Brest.
The passengers were the Secretary and Mrs.
Daniels; Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, Chief of
the Bureau of Construction and Repair; Rear
Admiral Robert S. Griffin, Chief of the Bureau of
Steam Engineering; Rear Admiral Ralph Earle,
Chief of the Bureau of Ordnance; Commander
Stewart E. Barber, Pay Corps, who was officially
attached to the <em>Corsair</em>; Commander Percy W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
Foote, personal aide to the Secretary; and Private
Secretary May.</p>

<p>Brest Harbor was a familiar panorama to the
few men aboard the <em>Corsair</em> who had shared the toil
and excitement of those early months of patrol
work offshore, almost a year before. Now, however,
the transports were crammed with troops homeward
bound, and there was no more convoying the
“empty buckets” out of Saint-Nazaire and Bordeaux
and Quiberon Bay, nor was there any chance
of a brush with the persistent U-boat which had
been dubbed “Penmarch Pete.”</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair</em> undertook her good-bye courtesies
and ceremonies, one of them a luncheon party on
board, at which the guests were Rear Admiral A. S.
Halstead who succeeded Admiral Wilson as commander
of the naval forces in France; Major General
Smedley D. Butler, commanding the embarkation
camp at Brest; Vice-Admiral Moreau and
Rear Admiral Grout of the French Navy and Mme.
Grout; and Commander Robert E. Tod, Director
of Public Works at Brest.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>Not much time was wasted in port. Two days
after arriving, on May 10th, the bunkers were
filled with coal, and there was precious little cursing
over the hard and dirty job which had so often
caused the crew to agree that what General Sherman
said about war was absurdly inadequate. It
was different now. Every shovel and basket of coal
meant steam to shove the old boat nearer home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>That homeward-bound pennant trailed jubilantly
from the masthead, a silk streamer of red, white,
and blue, one hundred and eighty feet long, into
whose folds had been fondly stitched the desires,
the yearnings, the anticipations of every man in
the ship. Only a few of them had stood, with bared
heads, on the <em>Corsair’s</em> deck when she had been
formally commissioned as a fourth-rate gunboat of
the United States Navy in May of 1917, and the
bright ensign had whipped in the breeze.</p>

<p>Many of that company had seen service in other
ships and some were civilians again, but memory
was apt to hark back to the <em>Corsair</em> with a certain
affection and regret. And wherever they were to be,
these youthful sailors would feel a thrill of pride
and kinship at sight of a Navy man and they would
kindle to the sentiment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But there’s something at the heart-strings that tautens when I meet</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A blue-clad sailor-man adrift, on shore leave from the fleet.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Lieutenant McGuire, bred to the sea and experienced
in ships, thought it over after he came home
and wrote these opinions of the <em>Corsair’s</em> company
and the work they did:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was a pleasure to watch how eagerly the boys
took hold of their new jobs and how rapidly they became
good sailors. For a comrade to stand by in danger,
give me first of all a plain, every-day, American gob.
He is not so much on the parade stuff, but offer him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
a chance to risk his skin or his life for his friend or his
flag and he is there every time.</p>

<p>If this war has helped us as a nation in no other
way, it has, I believe, taught hundreds of thousands of
men the meaning of their country’s flag, taught them
to love it as their own, and that to die for it is an honor
to be prized.</p>

<p>While the duty abroad was pretty strenuous at
times, yet the average American has the faculty of
making friends in every port, which helped to pass the
few hours at his disposal when not engaged in coaling
ship. How we did envy the boys in the oil-burners!</p>

<p>The chief petty officers and petty officers of the
American Navy are exceptionally intelligent and proficient
in their duties, and on many occasions helped
the average Reserve officer over rough places. I also
felt great admiration for the officers with whom I
served and came in contact, both Regular and
Reserve.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Of</span> the old crew, the crew which had sailed with
Pershing’s First Expeditionary Force, only
two officers and eighteen men watched the frowning
headlands of Brittany sink into the sea as the
<em>Corsair</em> turned her bow to follow the long trail
that led to the twin lights of Navesink and the skyline
of New York. A day at the Azores for coal and
she laid a course for Bermuda and another brief
call before straightening out for the last stretch of
the journey. On May 28th she steamed into her
home port after an absence just a little short of
two years. There was no uproarious welcome when
the gray <em>Corsair</em> slipped through the Narrows and
sought a berth at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The
war had ended more than half a year earlier. It
was already an old story, but the ship had done her
duty and was content with this.</p>

<p>A few days later she ceased to be enrolled in the
United States Navy. There was no ceremonious formality
and the documents in the case were exceedingly
brief, but they signified the end of a story
which had added a worthy page to the annals of
American manhood. “Ships are all right. It is the
men in them,” said one of Joseph Conrad’s wise old
mariners. This was true of the <em>Corsair</em> and the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
yachts of the Breton Patrol. And so the Navy Department
spoke the last word in this concise order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">
<em><span style="padding-right: 2em">Headquarters of the Third Naval</span><br>

<p>(Enclosure.) The U.S.S. <em>Corsair</em> is hereby placed
out of commission, June 9th, 1919.</p>
</div>

<p>Her owner surmised that the <em>Corsair</em> had been
run to death and worn out in the Bay of Biscay,
that she was to be regarded rather as a relic than a
yacht; but in this Mr. Morgan was happily disappointed.
The staunch ship was still fit to be overhauled
and made ready for the peaceful and leisurely
service of other days. In her old berth at
Fletcher’s Yard she swarmed with artisans instead
of bluejackets, and they found many things to be
done besides restoring the furniture, fittings, partitions,
and so on.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>A stalwart man may tumble down three flights
of stairs and escape without a broken neck, but he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>is bound to be considerably shaken up. This was
painfully the case with a yacht which had been
kept going month in and month out, the fires drawn
from under her boilers only when she positively
declined to make steam enough and was in a mood
to protest against such unfair treatment. That
December hurricane had been a bruising, almost
fatal experience, and the repairs made at Lisbon
could not be called final.</p>

<p>As a ship, however, the <em>Corsair</em> had strongly survived
the ordeal, and soon she began to resume the
semblance of a shapely, sea-going yacht. The graceful
bowsprit was restored to the clipper stem, the
deck cleared of gun mountings, and the overhang
was no longer cluttered with the gear of the depth
bombs. Chief Engineer Hutchison returned to his
own engine-room, and there was clangor and clatter
as gangs of mechanics repaired, replaced, and tuned
up machinery which had been driven to the limit
of endurance.</p>

<p>The <em>Corsair’s</em> steaming record in foreign service
had amounted to 49,983.6 miles from June, 1917, to
December, 1918, when she ceased cruising to spend
her time in English ports and at Queenstown. The
distance, by months, was as follows:</p>

<p>On July 31st, less than two months after being
placed out of commission as a naval vessel, the
<em>Corsair</em> hoisted the Commodore’s flag of the New
York Yacht Club. Trim and immaculate, she proceeded
to her anchorage at Glen Cove, to await
cruising orders. There were differences, however,
and the <em>Corsair</em> was not the same as of old. Freshly
painted, the hue of her funnel and hull was the
gray of the Navy. For a season, at least, the glistening
black of her hull was not to be restored. It
seemed more fitting, somehow, that in this way she
should recall her long service in helping guard the
road to France.</p>

<p>Upon her funnel were two service chevrons. The
regulations awarded a stripe for the first three
months overseas and another for a full year thereafter,
until the date of the armistice. The decks
were scraped and holystoned and spotless, but
where the guns had been there were wooden plugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
to mark the half-circles of the mounts, and the
pine planking was scarred where cases of shells had
been dragged to be ready for the swift team-work
of the agile gun crews. These, too, were marks of
honor which it seemed a pity to obliterate. They
signified that the <em>Corsair</em> was something more than
a yacht.</p>

<p>Another memento and reminder, to be highly
regarded by the ship’s company of those stirring
days, is a letter from the Commander-in-Chief of
the United States Naval Forces in European
Waters, who desired that his “well done” should
be included in this record. It is placed here by way
of “good-bye and fare-ye-well,” as the old chantey
sang it. Admiral Sims writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right fs80">

<p class="no-indent">
<span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Paine</span>:<br>
</p>

<p>To undertake to write the complete story of any one
ship of the American Navy and its experiences in the
war zone seems to me a task very well worth while.
Needless to say, the work of the yachts and their personnel
on the coast of France was splendid, and I am
only too glad to have an opportunity to express my
appreciation of them.</p>

<p>Because of the shortage of vessels suitable for convoy
and escort duty, and the gravely urgent circumstances,
the yachts were sent across with little time
for preparation or training and with few officers and
men of the Regular Navy in their complements. They
were an emergency flotilla, but I felt confident that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
they would quickly adapt themselves to the arduous
conditions of their service in European waters.</p>

<p>What did surprise me was that they were able to
weather a winter in the Bay of Biscay and to stay at
sea with the convoys when yachts were presumed to
be tucked in harbor. This was greatly to the credit of
the courage, seamanship, and hardihood of the men
who served in them. It was conspicuously true of the
<em>Corsair’s</em> encounter with the December hurricane in
which she almost foundered, but succeeded in making
port at Lisbon. A similar spirit was shown when this
vessel stood by the disabled steamer <em>Dagfin</em> and towed
her three hundred miles through an area in which
enemy submarines were operating.</p>

<p>With a steaming record of 50,000 miles on foreign
service, with the unusual number of fourteen enlisted
men appointed as commissioned officers, and with
repeated commendations from the Force Commander
in France, such a yacht served with honor to the flag
and the Navy and deserves the verdict of “Well Done,
<em>Corsair</em>.”</p>

<p>The yacht will always be tenanted with brave
memories. And I am sure that to her owner and to
Captain Porter, as long as she shall float, the
<em>Corsair</em> will seem to have caught and held in the
fabric of her somewhat of the spirit of those high-hearted
young Americans who manned and sailed
and fought her in the war zone. For a ship which
has faithfully withstood the manifold ordeals of the
sea becomes something more than a mere artifice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>of wood and steel. She seems almost sentient, like a
living thing to those who have shared her fortunes,
and therein is the immemorial romance of blue
water.</p>
